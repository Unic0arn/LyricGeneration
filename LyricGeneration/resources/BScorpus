I used to think
I had the answers to everything
Mm but now I know
That life doesn't always go my way. Yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman.
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learned to face up to this on my own. Woah.
I've seen so much more than you know now
 So don't tell me to shut my eyes
I'm not a girl * not a girl ,not yet a woman *
Not yet a woman
Just trying to find the woman in me
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

But if you look at me closely
You will see that in my eyes
This girl will always find her way

I'm not a girl
I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe
Not yet a woman
I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me, yeah
All I need is time
Whoa, all I need is time...
A moment that is mine
... that's mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
Not now
All I need is time  *All I need is time*
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

I'm not a girl

Ooooh, not yet a woman

He is a hustler
He's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs
He's unreliable.
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun

I know you told me
I should stay away.
I know you said
He's just a dog astray.
He is a rebel with a tainted heart
And even I know this a'int smart

But mama im in love with a criminal
And this type of love
Isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry
I will be alright
All reasons inside
I just cant deny
Love the guy

He is a villain of the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
That man's a snitch and unpredictable,
He's got no conscious
He got none, none, none, none

All I know, should let go, but no
'cause he's a rebel with a tainted heart

And even I know this ain't smart

But mama im in love with a criminal
And this type of love
Isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry
I will be alright
All reasons inside
I just cant deny
Love the guy

And he's got my name
Tatooed on his arm
His lucky charm,
So I guess its okay
He? with me

And I hear people talk
Trying to make remarks
Keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care

'Cause mama im in love with a criminal
And this type of love
Isn't rational, it's physical

Boy, what's this I see
Your girl, she looks just like me.
Blonde hair and dressed to a T.
You tell me, how can this be
Does she know I was the one,
who used to turn you on yeah
But you don't wanna talk about it.
When you think you can find,
someone to fill my shoe.
And you ask yourself why,
That she don't do the things I do.
And you can't deny,
that everywhere you go...
you see my face, hear my name,
and it eats you up inside!
You know I'm one of a kind,there'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind,You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes,
is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me
Why can't you see it girl
That your divinity.
Whenever he's touching me,
He's really thinking of me...
Does she know I was the one,
who used to turn you on yeah
But you don't wanna talk about
When you think you can find,
someone to fill my shoe.
And you ask yourself why,
That she don't do the things I do.
And you can't deny,
that everywhere you go,
you see my face, hear me name,
and it eats you up inside!


Someday I Will Understand
Britney Spears
Nothing seems to be the way
That it used to
Everything seems shallow
God give me truth
In me, and tell me somebody's watching
Over me and that is all I'm praying is that
Someday I Will Understand
In God's whole plan
And what he's done to me
Oh but maybe someday I will breathe
And I'll finally see
I'll see it all in my baby
Don't you run too fast my dear
Why don't you stop
Just stop and listen to your tears
They're all you've got
It's in you
You see somebody's watching
Over you and that is all I'm praying is that
Someday You Will Understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh but maybe someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
No moment will be more true
Than the moment I look at you
It's in you
You see somebody's watching
Over you and that is all I'm praying is that
Someday You Will Understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh but maybe someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
