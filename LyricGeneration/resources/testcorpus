This is a test
A man eats his food
A man wear a hat
A woman lies in her bed
god speaks to all men
god speaks to me that about that
half of me is the shit
I wonder if this thing will work
i have to eat food soon
eat and beer and all fun
i wonder if all men feels the same
this is why I speak up
such a wonderful world to live in
such as pineapples
