It's cold outside
It gets so hot in here 
And the boys and girls collide 
To The music in my ear 

Hear the children crying 
And I know it's time to go 
I hear the children crying 
Take me home 

A painted face 
And I know we haven't long 
We thought that we had the answers 
It was the questions we had wrong 

Hear the children crying 
And I know it's time to go 
I hear the children crying 
Take me home 

Say so, say so 
Say so, say so 

La lah la lah...La lah la lah...La lah lah... 

Say so, say so 
Say so, say so 

Call out your name 
Call out each name 
Call out your name 
Call out 
You better call out 
Call, call, call out 





I waited patiently for the Lord 
He inclined and heard my cry 
He brought me up out of the pit 
Out of the miry clay 

I will sing, sing a new song 
I will sing, sing a new song 

How long to sing this song? 
How long to sing this song? 
How long...how long...how long... 
How long...to sing this song 

He set my feet upon a rock 
And made my footsteps firm 
Many will see 
Many will see and fear 

I will sing, sing a new song 
I will sing, sing a new song 
I will sing, sing a new song 
I will sing, sing a new song 

How long to sing this song? 
How long to sing this song? 
How long...how long...how long... 
How long...to sing this song? 












Shake! Shake!

Don't go 
I believe in a celebration 
I believe you set me free 
I believe you can loose this chains 
I believe you can dance with me 
Dance with me 


Shake! Shake! 
Shake! Shake! 


I believe in the third world war 
I believe in the atomic bomb 
I believe in the powers that be 
But they won't overpower me 


And, and you can go there too 
And, and you can go go go go 


Shake! Shake! 
Shake! Shake! 


And we dance out of time 
And everything goes 'round and 'round 
And we don't have the time 
To watch the world go tumbling down 


Go! Go! 


I believe in the bells of Christchurch 
Ringing for this land 
I believe in the cells of Mountjoy 
There's an honest man 


And, and you can go there too 
And, and you can go go go go 


I believe in the walls of Jericho 
I believe they're coming down 
I belive in this city's children 
I believe the trumpet's sound 


(And you...) 
(Can go there too) 
(And you...) 
(can go go go go) 


And you can go there too 
And you can go go go go... 


I believe in what I'm doing 
What am I doing here... 








Starting a landslide in my ego 
Look from the outside 
To the world I left behind 

I'm dreaming 
You're awake 
If I were sleeping 
What's at stake 

A day without me 

Whatever the feelings 
I keep feeling 
What are the feelings 
You left behind 

Today's a day without me 

I started a landslide in my ego 
Look from the outside 
To the world I left behind 

In the world I left behind 
Wipe their eyes, and then let go 
To the world I left behind 
Shed a tear, and then let go 








From where I stand 
I can see thrugh you 
From where you're sitting, pretty one 
I know it got to you 


I see the stars in your eyes 
You want the truth, but you need the lies 
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino 
You give your life for rock n' roll 
Uh huh 


Stand, we're on a landslide of love 
You got everything you want 
But what you need you give away 


For primitive love 
And a ride on the mystery train 
A primitive love 
A room at the Heart... 
The Heartbreak Hotel 
A room at the Heartbreak 
Heartbreak Hotel 
A room at theHeartbreak 
Heartbreak Hotel 


You say it's love, it's not the money 
You let them suck your life out like honey 
Turning tricks, you're on the street 
Selling your kisses so bittersweet 


(Gospel voices) 


A primitive love 
A and a ride on the mystery train 
A primitive love 
A room at the Heart 
The Heartbreak Hotel 


A room at the Heartbreak, the Heartbreak, 
The Heartbreak Hotel, Hotel 
The Heartbreak Hotel, Hotel
The Heartbreak Hotel, Hotel
The Heartbreak Hotel, Hotel










And you know it's time to go 
through the sleet and driving snow 
across the fields of mourning to 
lights in the distance 

And you hunger for the time 
Time to heal, 'Desire', time 
And you earth moves beneath 
Your own dream landscape 

Oh, oh on borderland we run 
And still we run, we run and don't look back 
I'll be there, I'll be there 
Tonight, a highroad, a highroad out of here 

The city walls are all come down 
The dust a smoke screen all around to see 
Faces ploughed like fields that once 
Gave no resistance 

And we live by the side of the road 
On the side of a hill as the valleys explode 
Dislocated, suffocated 
The land grows weary of it's own 

Oh, oh on borderland we run 
And still we run, we run and don't look back 
Tonight, tonight 

The wind will crack in wintertime 
A bomb blast lightning waltz 
No spoken words, just a scream . . . 

Tonight we'll a bridge across the sea and land 
See the sky burning rain 
She will die and live again 
Tonight 

And you heart beats so slow 
Through the rain and fallen snow 
Across the fields of morning 
To a light that's in the distance 
Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep 
For tonight, at last 
I am coming home 
I am coming home 










Don't believe what you hear 
Don't believe what you see 
If you just close your eyes 
You can feel the enemy 
When I first met you girl 
You had fire in your soul 
What happened your face of melting in snow? 
Now it looks like this 

And you can swallow 
Or you can spit 
You can throw it up 
Or choke on it 
And you can dream 
So dream out loud 
You know that your time is coming 'round 
So don't let the bastards grind you down 

No, nothing makes sense 
Nothing seems to fit 
I know you'd hit out 
If you only knew who to hit 
And I'd join the movement 
If there was one I could believe in 
Yeah I'd break bread and wine 
If there was a church I could receive in 
'Cause I need it now 

To take the cup 
To fill it up 
To drink it slow 
I can't let you go 
I must be an acrobat 
To talk like this 
And act like that 
And you can dream 
So dream out loud 
And don't let the bastards grind you down 

Oh, it hurts baby 
What are we going to do? Now it's all been said 
No new ideas in the house and every book has been read 

And I must be an acrobat 
To talk like this 
And act like that 
And you can dream 
So dream out loud 
And you can find 
Your own way out 
And you can build 
And I can will 
And you can call 
I can't wait until 
You can stash 
And you can seize 
Responsibilities 
And I can love 
And I can love 
And I know that the tide is turning 'round 
So don't let the bastards grind you down 











You say you want 
Diamonds on a ring of gold 
You say you want 
Your story to remain untold 


But all the promises we make 
From the cradle to the grave 
When all I want is you 


You say you'll give me 
A highway with no one on it 
Treasure just to look upon it 
All the riches in the night 


You say you'll give me 
Eyes in a moon of blindness 
A river in a time of dryness 
A harbour in the tempest 
But all the promises we make 
From the cradle to the grave 
When all I want is you 


You say you want 
Your love to work out right 
To last with me through the night 


You say you want 
Diamonds on a ring of gold 
Your story to remain untold 
Your love not to grow cold 


All the promises we break 
From the cradle to the grave 
When all I want is you 


You...all I want is... 
You...all I want is... 
You...all I want is... 
You... 







Here today 
And gone tomorrow 
Crack the bone, get to the marrow 
To be the bee 
And the flower 
Before the sweetness turns to sour 

What we have we're gonna keep...Always 
What we've lost we don't need...Always 
What is it that won't let you sleep...Always 

Be the arrow 
And the target 
Put your head over the parapet 
Be uncool 
Yes, be awkward 
And don't look in the obvious place 
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate(???) 

Get down off your holy cloud...Always 
God will not deal with the proud...Always 
Well if you dream then dream out loud...Always 
Eternally yours...Always 

I want you 
I want you 
I want you 

Touching the other side 
I wanted to be in love(???) 
I wanted to call(???) 

You say come to know yourself...Always 
Don't find yourself in someone else...Always 
And always wear a safety belt...Always 
Wait for me I'm running late...Always 
This is the moment that we share...For always 
Turn each song into a prayer...Always 

Now and forever 
For always 
For always 
For always 
For always





Say goodnight 
She waits for me to 
Put out the light 
Lay there still 
She waits to break my will 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

Yes, if I know the truth 
How 'bout you? 

And in the daylight 
A blackbird makes a violent sight 
And when she is done 
She sleeps beside the wild 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

Yes, if I know the truth 
How 'bout you? 


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

Yes, if I know the truth 
How 'bout you? 








It was a cold and wet December day 
When we touched the ground at JFK 
Snow was melting on the ground 
On BLS I heard the sound 
Of an angel 

New York, like a Christmas tree 
Tonight this city belongs to me 
Angel 

Soul love 
This love won't let me go 
So long 
Angel of Harlem 

Birdland on fifty three 
The street sounds like a symphony 
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme 
Miles, and she's got to be an angel 

Lady Day got diamond eyes 
She sees the truth behind the lies 
Angel 

Soul love 
This love won't let me go 
So long 
Angel of Harlem 
Angel of Harlem 

She says it's heart 
Heart and soul... 
Yeah, yeah...(yeah) 
Yeah, yeah...(right now) 

Blue light on the avenue 
God knows they got to you 
An empty glass, the lady sings 
Eyes swollen like a bee sting 
Blinded you lost your way 
Through the side streets and the alleyway 
Like a star exploding in the night 
Falling to the city in broad daylight 
An angel in Devil's shoes 
Salvation in the blues 
You never looked like an angel 
Yeah, yeah 
Angel of Harlem 

Angel 
Angel of Harlem 
Angel 
Angel of Harlem... 









Wake up
The dawn of another dull day
Take up
Your dreams and on your way
Oh oh ooh


Daylight
Mother stands in the hall
Last night
Head against the wall
Oh oh ooh


When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day


Stop, shake out
They came my way
Oh oh ooh...


Boy, salute in a street uniform
Toy, soldier ripped and torn
Oh oh ooh


When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day


Stop, shout
They came my way
Oh oh ooh









Bright morning lights 
Wipe the sleep from another day's eye 
Turn away from the wall 
And there's Nothing at all 
Being naked and afraid 
In the open space of my bed 

I'll be with you now 
I'll be with you now 
I'll be with you now 
Real life on a cloud 
Real life 

Just as I am 
I awoke with a tear on my tongue 
I awoke with a feeling of never before 
In my sleep I discover the one 
But she ran with the morning sun 

I'll be with you now 
I'll be with you now 
I'll be with you now 

Real life on a cloud 
Real life 
Another time, another place 
Real life 
Another child has lost the race 
Real life 
Another time, another place 
Real life 
Your time, your price 

Real life 
Another time, another place 
Real life 
Another child has lost the race 

(vague foreign words, perhaps German) 

Real life 
Another time, another place 
Real life 
Your time, your price 





Watching your bright blue eyes 
In the freeze frame 
I've seen them so many times 
I feel like I must be your best friend 
You're looking fine, so fine, oh my 
Dressed up like a lovely day, oh 

Babyface, babyface 
Slow down child, let me untie your lace 
Babyface, babyface 
Cover girl with natural grace 
How could beauty be so kind 
To an ordinary guy 

Coming home late at night 
To turn you on 
Checking out every frame 
I've got slow motion on my side 
Turning around and around 
With the sound and colour 

Under my control, go 
Round and around, going down 
Dressed up like a lovely day 

Babyface, babyface 
Tin foil hair all tied up in lace 
Babyface, babyface 
Bitter sweet girl won't you give me a taste 
How could beauty be so kind 
To an ordinary guy 

Do do do do do do do do do...do do... 
Do do do do do do do do do...do do... 

Babyface, babyface 
Slow down child, let me untie your lace 
Babyface, babyface 
Open the door, let me unpack my case 
Babyface, babyface 
You're everywhere child 
You're all over the place 
Babyface, babyface 
You're coming to me from outer space 
Hou could beauty be so kind 
To an ordinary guy 










If you twist and turn away. 
If you tear yourself in two again. 
If I could, yes I would 
If I could, I would let it go. 

Surrender, dislocate. 
If I could throw this lifeless 
Lifeline to the wind. 
Leave this heart of clay, 
See you walk, walk away, 
Into the night. 
And through the rain. 
Into the half light, 
And through the flame. 
If I could throw myself, 
Set your spirit free. 
I'd lead your heart away, 
See you break, break away 
Into the light. 
And to the day. 

To let it go, 
And so to fade away. 
To let it go, 

And so fade away. 
I'm wide awake. 
I'm wide awake. 
I'm not sleeping. 
Oh, no, no. 

If you should ask then maybe 
They tell you what I would say. 
True colors fly in blue and black, 
bruised silken skies and burning flag. 
Colors crash, collide in blood shot eyes. 

If I could, you know I would. 
If I could, I would let it go. 
This desparation. 
Dislocation. 
Separation. 
Condemnation. 
Revelation. 
Temptation. 
Isolation. 
Desolation. 

Let it go, 
And so to fade away. 
To let it go, 
And so fade away. 
Oh, no 
I'm wide awake. 
I'm wide awake. 
I'm not sleeping. 
Oh, no no 










You don't have to break your heart 
In two my love 
You don't have to play a part 
It's you I love 
You don't have to hide from yourself 
You don't have to be someone else again 


You don't have to rescue me 
You don't have to watch me drown 
You don't have to give to me 
All I want is you 


Be there, my love 
Be there, tonight 
Be there, my love 
Be there, tonight 


You don't have to dress yourself up 
Or stay the same 
You don't have to smile 
If I say smile 


You don't have to be the best 
You don't have to give me rest 
All I want is all you have 
Nothing else 
Nothing 


Be there, my love 
Just be there, my love 


If you want the whole of me 
That's all you'll get 
I'll sing this song 
I'd give my health 
Give it all 
You don't have to... 


Ah, she comes on by 
She says, I need you, my love 
Ah, she says, all I want is you 


You don't have to play your little game 
If I fall apart 
You don't have to work those strings 
Or do those things 
You're enough in my heart 


You don't have to hide from yourself 
You don't have to be someone else 
All I want is all you have 
All I want is you 


Be there, my love 
Be there, tonight 
Be there, my love 
Be there, tonight 








The heart is a bloom 
Shoots up through the stony ground 
There's no room 
No space to rent in this town 


You're out of luck 
And the reason that you had to care 
The traffic is stuck 
And you're not moving anywhere 


You thought you'd found a friend 
To take you out of this place 
Someone you could lend a hand 
In return for grace 


It's a beautiful day 
Sky falls, you feel like 
It's a beautiful day 
Don't let it get away 


You're on the road 
But you've got no destination 
You're in the mud 
In the maze of her imagination 


You love this town 
Even if that doesn't ring true 
You've been all over 
And it's been all over you 


It's a beautiful day 
Don't let it get away 
It's a beautiful day 


Touch me 
Take me to that other place 
Teach me 
I know I'm not a hopeless case 


See the world in green and blue 
See China right in front of you 
See the canyons broken by cloud 
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out 
See the Bedouin fires at night 
See the oil fields at first light 
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth 
After the flood all the colors came out 


It was a beautiful day 
Don't let it get away 
Beautiful day 


Touch me 
Take me to that other place 
Reach me 
I know I'm not a hopeless case 


What you don't have you don't need it now 
What you don't know you can feel it somehow 
What you don't have you don't need it now 
Don't need it now 
Was a beautiful day

Boy girl, boy girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy girl


Finding out
I'm finding out the things
That I've been talking about
I'm finding all the things
That I've been missing out
Finding all the things
I lose my mind
Sometimes fall behind


You and I we live on the big ship
And time goes by
You make up and I believe a lady's lie
Your skin is colored strawberries and cream
Sometimes I scream


Boy girl, boy girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy girl


We go out
A picture or a disco or a roundabout
I walk you home, I hold you there
You're giving out
I open doors so I can shut your face
Know your place


Boy girl, boy girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy girl


You can take me in your hand
Stand back, leave me, come in
Up and down and all around
You will sideways to the ground


Boy girl, boy girl
When a boy meets a girl
When a boy meets a girl
When a boy meets a girl
When a boy meets a girl






In the howling wind comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly,
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Running scared in the valley below

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue
...ah...ah...

In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses
See the flames higher and higher

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
...ah...
Bullet the blue
...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...

This guy comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colors of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slappin' 'em down
One hundred, two hundred

And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
You take the staircase to the first floor
You turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside it's America
Outside it's America

Across the field you see the sky ripped open
See the rain through a gaping wound
Pounding on the women and children
Who run...
Into the arms...
Of America






It's Christmas 
Baby, please come home

The snow's coming down 
I'm watching it fall 
Watching the people around 
Baby please come home 


The church bells in town 
They're ringing a song 
What a happy sound 
Baby please come home 


They're singing deck the halls 
But it's not like Christmas at all 
I remember when you were here 
And all the fun we had last year 


Pretty lights on the tree 
I'm watching 'em shine 
You should be here with me 
Baby please come home 


Baby please come home 
Baby please come home 


They're singing deck the halls 
But it's not like Christmas at all 
I remember when you were here 
And all the fun we had last year 


If there was a way 
I'd hold back these tears 
But it's Christmas day 
Baby please come home 
Ohh... 


Baby please come home 
Baby please come home 
Baby please come home 
Ohh... 
Baby please come home 
Baby please come home 







You're a precious stone 
You're out on your own 
You know everyone in the world 
But you feel alone 
Daddy won't let you weep 
Daddy won't let you ache 
Daddy gives you as much as you can take 
A ha sha la, a ha sha la 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 

A little uptight 
You're a baby's fist 
Butterfly kisses up and down your wrist 
When you see daddy coming 
You're licking your lip 
Nails bitten down to the quick 
A ha sha la, a ha sha la 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 

You've got a head full of traffic 
You're a siren's song 
You cry for mama 
And daddy's right along 
He gives you the keys to a flamin' car 
Daddy's with you wherever you are 
Daddy's a comfort 
Daddy's your best friend 
Daddy'll hold your hand right up to the end 
A ha sha la, a ha sha la 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday's 
alright... 







She is benediction 
She is addicted to he 
She is the root connection and 
She is connecting with me 


Here I go and I don't know why 
I spin so ceaselessly 
Could it be he's taking over me 


I'm dancing barefoot 
Headed for a spin 
Some strange music drags me in 
It makes me come up like some heroine 


She is sublimation 
She is the essence of thee 
She is concentrating on 
He who is chosen by she 


Here I go when I don't know why 
I spin so ceaselessly 
Could it be he's taking over me 


I'm dancing barefoot 
Headed for a spin 
Some strange strange music drags me in 
It makes me come up like some heroine 


She is recreation 
She intoxicated by thee 
She has the slow sensation that 
He is levitating with she 


Here I go when I don't know why 
I spin so ceaselessly 
'Til I lose my sense of gravity 


I'm dancing barefoot 
Heading for a spin 
Some strange music drives me on 
Makes me come up like some heroine 


Oh God I feel for you 
Oh God I feel for you 
Oh God I feel for you 
Oh God I feel for you 







Angel, everything's gonna be alright 
Angel, everything's gonna work out tonight 
Thirteen years old, sweet as rose 
Every petal of her wafer thin 
Love will make you mine 
Creep up from behind 
Get you jumping out of your skin 
Angel...it's sink or swim 


Deep in the heart 
Deep in the heart of this place 
Deep in the heart 
Deep in the heart of this place 


Door is closed behind me now 
The Window is sealed to shut out the light 
Green as the leaves 
And the cure of the meadow stain 
Do your work, it'll work out right 


Deep in the heart 
Deep in the heart of this place 
Deep in the heart 
Deep in the heart of this place 


The scent of cedar, I can still see her 
You can't return to the place you never left 
Angel, we'll make it work out tonight 
Angel, I wanna be home tonight 


Door is closed behind me now 
The window is sealed, they shut out the light 
Green as the leaves 
And the cure of the meadow stain 
I do my work, and you'll work out right 


Deep in the heart 
Deep in the heart of this place 
Deep in the heart 
Deep in the heart of this place... 







Lover, I'm on the street 
Gonna go where the bright lights 
And the big city meet 
With a red guitar...on fire 
Desire 


She's a candle burning in my room 
Yeah I'm like the needle, needle and spoon 
Over the counter with a shotgun 
Pretty soon everybody got one 
And the fever when I'm beside her 
Desire, desire... 


And the fever...getting higher 
Desire, desire...burning, burning 


She's the dollars 
She's my protection 
Yeah she's a promise 
In the year of election 
Oh sister, I can't let you go 
Like a preacher stealing hearts 
At a traveling show 
For love or money money money 
money money money money money 
money money money 
And the fever, getting higher 
Desire, desire, desire, desire 
Desire, desire 








I don't know you 
And you don't know the half of it 
I had a starring role 
I was the bad guy who walked out 
They said be careful where you aim 
'Cause where you aim you just might hit 
You can hold onto something so tight 
You've already lost it 

Dragging me down 
That's not the way it used to be 
You can't even remember 
What I'm trying to forget 

It was a dirty day 
Dirty day 

You're looking for explanations 
I don't even understand 
If you need someone to blame 
Throw a rock in the air 
You'll hit someone guilty 

From father to son 
In one life has begun 
A work that's never done 
Father to son 

And love...it won't last kissin' time 
And love...it won't last kissin' time 
And love...it won't last kissin' time 

Get it right 
There's no blood thicker than ink 
Hear what I say 
Nothing's simple as you think 

Wake up 
Some things you can't get around 
I'm in you 
More so when they put me in the ground 

These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill 
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill... 











you can reach but you can't grab it 
you can't hold it control it, you can't bag it 

you can push but you can't direct it

take these hands they're good for nothing
you know these hands have never worked a day
take these boots they're going nowhere
you know these boots they don't want to stray
you got my head filled with songs
you got my shoelaces undone
take my shirt go on take it off me
you can tear it up
if you can tie me down

DO YOU FEEL LOVED? DO YOU FEEL LOVED?

TAKE THE colours of my imagination
TAKE THE scent hanging in the air
take this tangle of a conversation
and turn it into your own prayer
with my fingers as you want them
with my nails under your hide
with my teeth at your back and my tongue to tell you the sweetestlies.

DO YOU FEEL LOVED? DO YOU FEEL LOVED?
AND IT LOOKS like the SUN BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE RAIN

love's a bully pushing and shoving
in the belly of a woman
heavy rhythm taking over
to stick together
a man and a woman
stick together
man and woman
stick together& 133;.

DO YOU FEEL LOVED?
DO YOU FEEL LOVED?

AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUN
BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE RAIN
and THERE'S HEAT IN THE SUN TO SEE US THROUGH THE RAIN









I can't hold you baby 
I been thinking 
I can't hold you 
Another sign above 


Doctor, doctor 
Tell me what to do 
I got heartbreak in my pocket 
I got sunlight next to you 


Doctor, doctor 
Will the difference be adjourned 
Could I help 'em only standing 
Could I be the one to do 


Doctor, doctor 
What ??? you 
I been round by the river land 
Where the sun burns burns bold and 
All he ever [track skips ] next to you 


[Music fades out, then back in] 


Any wanna gonna man of wanna buy a taking you down 
I was thinking of you 
Round about wanna gonna say 


Any other bonna down a on ya all the time that you wanted 
I was all in the grave...I was down the ground 


Put another [Gets cut off] 








My heart is longing for you, love 
I cared for you more then you knew 
Though you have broken each promise 
Yesterday's dreams are untrue 


Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow 
When sunshine brings memories of you 
My sunshine will turn into sorrow 
As a dream of the love you once knew 


Why should I always be lonesome 
When sunny and blue are the skies 
While shadows and loneliness linger 
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes 


Why did you promise me sweetheart 
Never to leave me alone 
Yesterday's sunshine is faded 
You're love wasn't true like my own 


Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow 
When sunshine brings memories of you 
My sunshine will turn into sorrow 
As a dream of the love we once knew 


Why should I always be lonesome 
When sunny and blue are the skies 
While shadows and loneliness linger 
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes 







Take my hand 
You know I'll be there 
If you can 
I'll cross the sky for your love 
For I have promised 
Oh, to be with you tonight 
And for the time that will come 

Take my hand 
You know I'll be there 
If you can 
I'll cross the sky for your love 
And I understand 
These winds and tides 
This change of times 
Won't drag you away 
Hold on, and hold on tightly 
Hold on, and don't let go 
Of my love 

The storms will pass...the storm will pass... 
It won't be long now...it won't be long now... 
His love will last 
His love will last...forever 

Take my hand 
You know I'll be there 
If you can 
I'll cross the sky for your love 
Give you what I hold dear 

Hold on, hold on tightly 
Hold on, hold on tightly 
Rise up, rise up 
With wings like eagles 
You run, you run 
You run and not grow weary 

...Take my hand, take my hand... 
Hold on, and hold on tightly 
Hold on, hold on tightly 
To this love...last forever 
To this love...last forever 

Take my hand 
Take my hand... 









The sea it swells like a sore head 
And the night, it is aching 
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed 
And the day it is breaking 


On rainy days we'd go swimming out 
On rainy days, swimming in the sound 
On rainy days we'd go swimming out 


You're in my mind 
All of the time 
I know that's not enough 
If the sky can crack 
There must be some way back 
For love and only love 


Car alarm 
Won't let you back to sleep 
You're kept awake 
Dreaming someone else's dream 
Coffee is cold 
But it'll get you through 
Compromise 
That's nothing new to you 


Let's see colors that have never been seen 
Let's go to places no one else has been 


In my mind 
All of the time 
I know that's not enough 
If the sky can crack 
There must be some way back 
To love and only love 


Electrical storm 
Electrical storm 
Electrical storm 
Baby don't cry 


It's hot as hell 
Honey, in this room 
Sure hope the weather will break soon 
The air is heavy, heavy as a truck 
Hope the rain will wash away our bad luck 


The sky can crack 
There must be some way back 
For love and only love 


Electrical storm 
Electrical storm 
Electrical storm 


Baby don't cry 
Baby don't cry 
Oh baby don't cry 
Oh baby don't cry










High, higher than the sun 
You shoot me from a gun 
I need you to elevate me here 


At corner of your lips 
As the orbit of your hips 
Eclipse 
You elevate my soul 


I've got no self control 
Been living like a mole now 
Going down, excavation 
I and I in the sky 
You make me feel like I can fly 
So high 
Elevation 


A star 
Lit up like a cigar 
Strung out like a guitar 
Maybe you can educate my mind 


Explain all these controls 
Can't sing but I've got soul 
The goal is elevation 


A mole 
Digging in a hole 
Digging up my soul now 
Going down, excavation 


I and I in the sky 
You make me feel like I can fly 
So high 
Elevation 


Love 
Lift me up out of these blues 
Won't you tell me something true 
I believe in you 


A mole 
Digging in a hole 
Digging up my soul now 
Going down, excavation 


Higher now 
In the sky 
You make me feel like I can fly 
So high 
Elevation 


Elevation 
Elevation 
Elevation 
Elevation 








Black flesh in here. 

Black flesh of my only love 
Tell me, open my eyes. 
Black flesh come into my own mind, 
Telling me to sing... 
And I believe in you, 
And I believe in you, 
White flesh sees the sky [That's nice], and he turns its sight from you, 
But she won't turn my bag, 
And I know that real tears are blue... 

And you know, 
And your sky is faith in blue, 
And your heart been so cold when I'm with you, 
And you feel, like no one told you to, 
And you know time is on your side 
And you'll talk with me, 
Oh, don't talk to me, 
Aw, don't talk to me, 
Don't talk to me... 

And you know, 
Like no one told you how, 
But you know, 
Well, The King that howed has howled 
And revealed, like sentimental, 
But you don't care 
Without you're sharing 
In your hear ar ar art hear ar ar ar 
Heart, there sleeps a hope you see: 
I'm breaking through for you and me. 

And you know, 
Although no one told you to, 
And you found out when you were going: 
We're two. 
And your through with me 
But I know that you'll be back for more... 

And you know, 
And though no one told you so, 
And you know: 
The sky like a heart is shades of blue. 
And you want, 
You want to let go oh oh... 

We live on the outside, 
Turn away, fade away, 
You can drop me down, but don't break me: 
In your castle stay 
Au di ence sighs in your heart and mind, 
Au di ence dies in your heart... and mine... 

Someday love will come, 
Lovin' is in your sigh, 
The War King too. 
So let me in your heart: 
It beats like something new... 

(I need The Edge) 

Keep The Edge! 
I'm at home, 
Mm an' love is... 
Stay, stay sad and resigned, 
Don't stay sad, no more be sad, 
Don't stay sad, no more be sad, 
Don't stay sad, no more be sad... 
And you know, 
And though no one told you how, (told you how) 
And you know, 
And you wipe the sweat off your white brow. (your white brow) 
And you care, (care, care) 
And though no one told, you tried, 
And your heart (and your heart) is left out from the side (from the side), 
And the rain beats down, 
And the shame (keeps) on beating down, 
And this rain keeps on coming down, 
And this sky... (is black) 

I'll keep the voice of emotion you want 
I'll keep on going enjoyin' instinct, Brian 
I gave away some energy why? 
I'll keep my voice up, [Keep it up!] can you go louder? 
I'll keep my voice up loud and gain the Ruler. 

And you know, 
And although knowing told you sky blue, 
And you feel like needle pricks and you don't care, 
You'll say, Go and kill Lear! Or the older side of me. 
Don't you leave! 
Don't leave out part of me! 
Then I can't feel it! 
I can't feel anymore! [Keep it up!] 
And I can't hold on! [Keep it going!] 
And I don't seem that flawed. 
And you pick me up: 
Bits and pieces 
On this....floor 









Give me one more chance 
And you'll be satisfied 
Give me two more chances 
You won't be denied 


Well my heart is where it's always been 
My head is somewhere in between 
Give me one more chance 
Let me be your lover tonight 


(Check it out) 


You're the real thing 
Yeah the real thing 
You're the real thing 
Even better than the real thing 
Child... 


Give me one last chance 
And I'm gonna make you sing 
Give me half a chance 
To ride on the waves that you bring 


You're honey child to a swarm of bees 
Gonna blow right through you like a breeze 
Give me one last dance 
We'll slide down the surface of things 


You're the real thing 
Yeah the real thing 
You're the real thing 
Even better than the real thing 
Child... 


We're free to fly the crimson sky 
The sun won't melt our wings tonight 


Oh now...here she comes 


Take me higher 
Take me higher 
You take me higher 
You take me higher 


You're the real thing 
Yeah the real thing 
You're the real thing 
Even better than the real thing 
Even better than the real thing 
Even better than the real thing










Hearts gone astray 
Keeping up when they go 
I went away 
Just when you needed me so 
You won't regret 
I'll come back begging you 
Don't you forget 
Welcome love we once knew 
Yeah 


Open up your eyes 
Then you'll realize 
Here I said was my 
Everlasting love 


Need you by my side 
Come and be my bride 
You'll never be denied 
Everlasting love 


From the very start 
Open up your heart 
Feel the love you've got 
Everlasting love 


This love will last forever 
This love will last forever 


Hearts gone astray 
Keeping up when they go 
I went away 
Just when you needed me so 
You won't regret 
I'll come back begging you 
Don't you forget 
Welcome love we once knew 
Yeah... 


When love's river flows 
No one really knows 
'Til someone's there to show the 
Way to lasting love 


Like the sun it shines 
Endlessly it shines 
You always will be mine 
Eternal love 


Whatever love went wrong 
Ours would still be strong 
We'd have our own 
Everlasting love 


This love will last forever 
This love will last forever

Never be denied

Feel the love you've got 


Everlasting love 









You know he got the cure
You know he went astray
He used to stay awake
To drive the dreams he had away
He wanted to believe
In the hands of love

His head it felt heavy
As he cut across the land
A dog started crying
Like a broken hearted man
At the howling wind
At the howling wind

He went deeper into black
Deeper into white
Could see the stars shining
Like nails in the night
He felt the healing
Healing, healing
Healing hands of love
Like the stars shiny shiny
From above

Hand in the pocket
Finger on the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
His heart he could feel
Was beating, beating
Beating, beating oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love

My love

Saw the hands that build
Can also pull down

The hands of love









Oooh...oooh...oooh...oooh... 
I! 
Yo! 
Falling, falling 
The sun is burning black 
Falling falling 
It's beating on my back 
With a fire, fire 
With a fire, fire 

Oooh...oooh... 
Falling, falling 
And the moon is running red 
Falling, falling 
It's pulling me instead 
With a fire 
Oh...oh... 
Fire 
Oh...oh... 

But there's a fire inside 
When I'm falling over 
There's a fire in me 
When I call out 
I feel some fire, fire 
I'm going home 

Falling, falling 
The stars are falling down 
Falling, falling 
They knock me to the ground 
With a fire 
Oh...oh... 
Fire 
Oh...oh... 

But there's a fire inside 
When I'm falling over 
There's a fire in me 
When I call out 
There's a fire inside 
When I'm falling over 
I feel the fire, fire 
I'm going home 








Some folks are born made to wave the flag 
Yeah, the red, white, and blue 
When the band plays 'Hail To The Chief' 
Yeah, they'll point the cannon at you 


It ain't me, it ain't me 
I'm no millionaire's son 
It ain't me, it ain't me 
I ain't no fortunate one 


Some folks are born silver spoon in hand 
Well, they help themselves, yeah 
When the taxman comes to the door 
House looks a like a rummage sale 


It ain't me, it ain't me 
I ain't no millionaire's son 
It ain't me, it ain't me 
I ain't no fortunate one, no 


Some folks inherit star spangled eyes 
Yeah, when they send you down to war 
Well, when you ask them how much you should give 
Yeah, it's always more, more, more 


It ain't me, it ain't me 
I ain't no senator's son 
It ain't me, it ain't me 
I'm no fortunate one 


It ain't me, it ain't me 
I ain't no military son 
It ain't me, it ain't me 
I ain't no fortunate son 
Take it away... 






Gloria...
I try to sing this song
I, I try to stand up
But I can't find my feet
I try, I try to speak up
But only in you I'm complete

Gloria...in te domine
Gloria...exultate
Gloria...Gloria
Oh Lord, loosen my lips

I try to sing this song
I, I try to get in
But I can't find the door
The door is open
You're standing there
You let me in

Gloria...in te domine
Gloria...exultate
Oh Lord, if I had anything
Anything at all
I'd give it to you
I'd give it to you

Gloria...Gloria...










I try to sing this song. 
I try to stand up. 
But I can't find my feet. 
I try, I try to speak up. 
But only in you I'm complete. 

Gloria, in Te Domine 
Gloria, exultate 

Oh lord, loosen my lips? 
I try to sing this song. 
I try to get in, 
But I can't find the door. 
The door is open. 
You're standing there, 
Let me in. 

Gloria, Gloria 

Oh Lord, if I have anything, anything at all, 
I'll give it to you.

Don't believe the devil 
I don't believe his book 
But the truth is not the same 
Without the lies he made up 

Don't believe in excess 
Success is to give 
Don't believe in riches 
But you should see where I live 
I...I believe in love 

Don't believe in forced entry 
Don't believe in rape 
But every time she passes by 
Wild thoughts escape 
I don't believe in death row 
Skid row or the gangs 
Don't believe in the Uzi 
It just went off in my hand 
I...I believe in love 

Don't believe in cocaine 
Got a speed ball in my head 
I could cut and crack you open 
Do you hear what I said 
Don't believe them when they tell me 
There ain't no cure 
The rich stay healthy 
While the sick stay poor 
I...I believe in love 

Don't believe in Goldman 
His type like a curse 
Instant karma's going to get him 
If I don't get him first 
Don't believe that rock 'n' roll 
Can really change the world 
As it spins in revolution 
It spirals and turns 
I...I believe in love 

Don't believe in the 60's 
The golden age of pop 
You glorify the past 
When the future dries up 
Heard a singer on the radio late last night 
He says he's gonna kick the darkness 
'til it bleeds daylight 
I...I believe in love 

I feel like I'm falling 
Like I'm spinning on a wheel 
It always stops beside of me 
With a presence I can feel 
I...I believe in love 
Stop!

Grace 
She takes the blame 
She covers the shame 
Removes the stain 
It could be her name 


Grace 
It's a name for a girl 
It's also a thought that 
Changed the world 


And when she walks on the street 
You can hear the strings 
Grace finds goodness 
In everything 


Grace 
She's got the walk 
Not on a ramp or on chalk 
She's got the time to talk 


She travels outside 
Of karma, karma 
She travels outside 
Of karma 


When she goes to work 
You can hear the strings 
Grace finds beauty 
In everything 


Grace 
She carries a world on her hips 
No champagne flute for her lips 
No twirls or skips 
Between her fingertips 


She carries a pearl 
In perfect condition 
What once was hurt 
What once was friction 
What left a mark 
No longer stings 


Because grace makes beauty 
Out of ugly things 


Grace finds beauty 
In everything 


Grace finds goodness 
In everything 









I heard there was a secret chord
That David played to pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do you
It goes like this, the fourth the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing, Hallelujah



Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah


You say I took the name in vain
Well I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken, Hallelujah


Hallelujah...


I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I learned to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my lips, Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's no complaint you hear tonight
It's not some pilgrim who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah







Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun


She's not a girl who misses much
She's not a girl who misses much


Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun


Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun


She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd
With the multicoloured mirrors on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes wide open
And the hands busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust


Hey, I need a fix 'cause I'm going down


Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun


Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun


I need a fix cause I'm going down
I need a fix cause I'm going down
I need a fix cause I'm going down
To the bits that I left uptown


I need a fix cause I'm going down, uptown
Need a fix cause I'm going down, uptown


Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a, a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun






Like a desert needs rain 
Like a town needs a name 
I need your love 

Like a drifter needs a room 
Hawkmoon 
I need your love 
I need your love 

Like a rhythm unbroken 
Like drums in the night 
Like sweet soul music 
Like sunlight 
I need your love 

Like coming home 
And you don't know where you've been 
Like black coffee 
Like nicotine 
I need your love (I need your love) 
I need your love (I need your love) 
I need your love (I need your love) 

When the night has no end 
And the day yet to begin 
As the room spins around 
I need your love 
I need your love 

Like a Phoenix rising needs a holy tree 
Like the sweet revenge of a bitter enemy 
I need your love 

Like the hot needs the sun 
Like honey on her tongue 
Like the muzzle of a gun 
Like oxygen 
I need your love (I need your love) 
I need your love (I need your love) 
I need your love (I need your love) 

When the night has no end 
And the day yet to begin 
As the room spins around 
I need your love 

I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 

Like thunder needs rain 
Like a preacher needs pain 
Like tongues of flame 
Like a sheet stained 
I need your love 
I need your love 

Like a needle in a vein 
Like someone to blame 
Like a thought unchained 
Like a runaway train 
I need your love 

I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 

Like faith needs a doubt 
Like a freeway out 
I need your love 

Like powder needs a spark 
Like lies need the dark 
I need your love 

In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 
In the heart of the heat of the love...in the heart of the heat of the love... 







See the sun rise over her skin 
Don't change it 
See the sun rise over her skin 
Dawn changes everything 
Everything 
And the delta sun 
Burns bright and violet 

Mississippi and the cotton wool heat 
Sixty six a highway speaks 
Of deserts dry 
Of cool green valleys 
Gold and silver veins 
Of the shining cities 

In this heartland 
In this heartland soil 
In this heartland 
Heaven knows this is a heartland 
Heartland, heartland 

See the sun rise over her skin 
She feels like water in my hand 
Freeway like a river cuts through this land 
Into the side of love 
Like a burning spear 
And the poison rain 
Brings a flood of fear 
Through the ghost ranch hills 
Death valley waters 
In the towers of steel 
Belief goes on and on 

In this heartland 
In this heartland soil 
In this heartland 
Heaven knows this is a heartland 
Heartland 
Heaven knows this is a heartland 
Heartland, heartland 
Heartland 
Heaven's day here in the heartland 
Heart 










This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles. We're stealing it back... 

When you get to the bottom 
You go back to the top of the slide 
And you stop and you turn 
And you go for a ride 
Then you get to the bottom 
Then you see me again 

Do you, don't you want me to love you 
Coming down fast, I'm right here above you 
Tell me tell me tell me the answer 
Ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer 

Helter skelter 
Helter skelter 
Helter skelter 
Oooh... 

Do you, don't you want me to make you 
I'm coming down fast now, don't let me break you 
Tell me tell me tell me the answer 
You ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer 

Helter skelter 
Helter skelter 
Helter skelter 
Oooh... 

When you get to the bottom 
You go back to the top of the slide 
And you turn and you stop 
And you go for a ride 
Then you get to the bottom 
Then you see me again 

Do you or don't you want me to love you 
Coming down fast I'm right here above you 
Tell me tell me tell me the answer 
Ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer 

Helter skelter 
Helter skelter 
Helter skelter 
Oooh... 

Again... 

Helter skelter 
Helter skelter 
Helter skelter 
Oooh... 









It works searching
Those aim
It comes on when you feel it again
I'm lost and I'm wasting for your time


It comes changes
Come around real soon
Why the man
That we coming through
Where the stars
Lie in coals in the room, day



It come higher
Ride like the sun
She's like the colors
Of everyone


He went my way
I come once
Right in the colors
All in the sun


Our love is imaginary rain
Our love across the heaven, day


It comes in color
Outside the day
Right up here and all the chain
One morning's raising to her stain









You don't know how you took it 
You just know what you got 
Oh Lordy you've been stealing 
From the thieves and you got caught 
In the headlights 
Of a stretch car 
You're a star 


Dressing like your sister 
Living like a tart 
They don't know what you're doing 
Babe, it must be art 
You're a headache 
In a suitcase 
You're a star 


Oh no, don't be shy 
You don't have to go blind 
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me 


You don't know how you got here 
You just know you want out 
Believing in yourself 
Almost as much as you doubt 
You're a big smash 
You wear it like a rash 
Star 


Oh no, don't be shy 
It takes a crowd to cry 
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me 


They want you to be Jesus 
They'll go down on one knee 
But they'll want their money back 
If you're alive at thirty three 
And you're turning tricks 
With your crucifix 
You're a star 


(Oh child) 


Of course you're not shy 
You don't have to deny love 
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me 














Julie says 
John I'm getting nowhere 
I wrote this letter 
Hope to get someplace soon 
I want to get up 
When I wake up 
But when I get up 
I fall down 

Julie wake up 
Julie tell the story 
You wrote the letter 
Said you were gonna get there someday 
Gonna walk in the sun 
And the wind and the rain 
Never walk back again 

Now you fall down 
You're falling down 
You fall down 
You fall down 

Julie say something 
Julie say you're sorry 
You're gonna get better 
You better not leave me here anyway 
I want to get up 
When you wake up 
When I get up 

I fall down 
When I'm falling down 
I fall down 
I broke myself 

I fall 
I fall down 
I'm falling down 
I fall down 
When you fall down 
When I'm falling down 
Is when you're falling down 
When you fall down 
I fall down 
I fall down 









Down by the motion 
Down by the girl 
Down into let go of me 
I don't ever hurt 
We shadow down 
We shadow down 
By the water land 


Baby don't move it 
Don't knock me in the tide 
I'm like the sun and 
You're like the sand 
Don't knock me down 
Don't knock me 
I feel free 


And I...I feel free 
And I...feel free 


(Sixty nine) 
(Sixty nine...) 


She's a'calling me 
Down want to water 
I like a court you You understand it 
I under war 
A whispering shadow 


Don't tell me that 
I live a going 
I am the storm 
To all that was is kicking me 
Ever take me down 
Take me down tonight 
Take me down town 


And I...feel free 
Well I...feel free 


And if a chance 
Don't take no choice 
Another time 
(Sixty nine) 


I feel free 
I feel free such a lie 
And I feel walking in the sun 
And I feel running with you one 
And I feel nothing in the, nothing in 
I feel nothing in your time 


I feel haunted in your life 
I feel talking in your 
Walking back in you, baby 
Nothing in your touch 
Live within your blood 
Take me, I'm walking, waking 
Hoping, waiting in the sun beats 
In your heart 


And babe it gives me 
I...I feel free 









I have climbed highest mountain 
I have run through the fields 
Only to be with you 
Only to be with you 

I have run 
I have crawled 
I have scaled these city walls 
These city walls 
Only to be with you 

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 

I have kissed honey lips 
Felt the healing in her fingertips 
It burned like fire 
This burning desire 

I have spoke with the tongue of angels 
I have held the hand of a devil 
It was warm in the night 
I was cold as a stone 

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 

I believe in the kingdom come 
Then all the colors will bleed into one 
Bleed into one 
Well, yes I'm still running 

You broke the bonds 
And you loosed the chains 
Carried the cross 
Of my shame 
Of my shame 
You know I believed it 

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for 









I was talking 
I was talking to myself 
Somebody else 
Talk, talk, talking 
I couldn't hear a word 
A word you said 

He was my brother, brother 
I said there was no other 
Way out of here 
Be my brother, brother 
Gotta get out 
Gotta get out 

I was walking 
I was walking into walls 
I'm back again 
I just keep walking 
I walk into a window 
To see myself 
And my reflection 
When I thought about it 
My direction 
Going nowhere 
Going nowhere 

No one, no one is blinder 
Than he who will not see 
No one, no one is blinder 
Than me 

I was talking 
I was talking in my sleep 
I can't stop talk, talk, talking 
I'm talking to you 
It's up to you 

Be my brother, brother 
There is another way out of here 
In my brother, brother 
Gotta get out 
Gotta get out 
Gotta get out of here 









I was on the outside when you said 
You said you needed me 
I was looking at myself 
I was blind, I could not see 

A boy tries hard to be a man 
His mother takes him by his hand 
If he stops to think he starts to cry 
Oh why 

If you walkaway, walkaway 
I walkaway, walkaway 
I will follow 

If you walkaway, walkaway 
I walkaway, walkaway 
I will follow 
I will follow 

I was on the inside 
When they pulled the four walls down 
I was looking through the window 
I was lost, I am found 

Walkaway, walkaway 
I walkaway, walkaway 
I will follow 
If you walkaway, walkaway, 
I walkaway, walkaway 
I will follow 
I will follow 

Your eyes make a circle 
I see you when I go in there 
Your eyes...your eyes...your eyes...your eyes 

If you walkaway, walkaway 
I walkaway, walkaway 
I will follow 

If you walkaway, walkaway 
I walkaway, walkaway 
I will follow 
I will follow 
I will follow 
I will follow 
I will follow...follow 










It's a beautiful day today
Everything is going my way
Even the words are doing what I say
Oh babe...got to get away


To be impossible
Isn't that difficult
In the city you're invisible
When you come from a small town


Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby...please


A tourist in a traffic jam
Baby sham and handy cam
I'm not your mother, you're not my man
I'm not your baby


Don't treat me like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick
Don't need no doctor, I'm not ill
I'm not your baby


Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby...please


Cut out the poetry
Let's hit the main artery
No time for a tourniquet
Let the colour's all run out of me


You brought me all kinds of goods
Now my heart is so full up it hurts
It's heavy as a shopping bag
It's full of things I should give back


Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby...please


Don't want you to cover me
Smother me or mother me
I like to feel this incomplete
I'm not your baby 

Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby...please


Not dizzy, just busy
Didn't drink nothing fizzy
No pills to feel easy
Don't know what got into me


Daylight's a kind of robbery
The night is your geography
So you're not white, you're pink and rosy
You could be right, but you're way above me


Me, I'm in recovery
A star of pornography
I'm a tourist, there's a lot to see
You don't like the photographs of me


So you've got a lot to say
You don't sleep around, but sometimes you stray
You don't believe, often times you pray
For something, what is it babe


Don't treat me like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick
Don't need no doctor, I'm not sick
I'm not your baby


Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby...please


I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby









I have got you under my skin 
I've got you deep in the heart of me 


So deep in my heart 
You're nearly a part of me 
I've got you under my skin 


I have tried so not to give in 
I have said to myself this affair 
Never gonna go somewhere 


But why should I try to resist 
When baby I know so well 
That I've got you under my skin 


I would sacrifice anything 
Come what might 
For the sake of holding you near 
In spite of a warning voice 
That comes in the night 
It repeats and it shouts in my ear 


Don't you know blue eyes 
You never can win 
Use your mentality 
Wake up to reality 


But each time I do 
Just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 


'cause I've got you under my skin 


I'd sacrifice anything 
Come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice 
That comes in the night 
It repeats and it shouts in my ear 


Don't you know you old fool 
You never can win 
Use your mentality 
Wake up to reality 


But each time that I do 
Just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 


'cause I've got you under my skin 
And I love you (when you're) under my skin 










nobody else here baby no one else here to blame 
no one to point the finger it's just you and me and the rain 
nobody made you do it, no one put words in your mouth 
nobody here taking orders when love took a train heading south 
it's the blink leading the blond 
it's the stuff the stuff of country songs 

HEY IF GOD WILLS SEND HIS ANGELS 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND A SIGH 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
Would everything be alright? 

God has got his phone off the hook babe would he even pick up if he could? 
It's been a while since we saw that child hangin' round this neighbourhood 
see His mother dealing in a doorway see Father Christmas with a begging bowl 
Jesus sister's eyes are a blister THE HIGH STREET never looked so low 

it's the blind leading the blond 
it's the cops collecting for the cons 
so where is the hope and where is the faith and the love? 
What's that you say to me 
does love light up your Christmas tree? 
The next minute you're blowing a fuse 
and the cartoon network turns into news 

HEY IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND A SIGN 
WELL IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
WHERE DO WE GO 

Jesus never let me down you know Jesus used to show me the score 
then they put Jesus in show business now it's hard to get in the door 

it's the stuff it's the stuff of country songs 
but I guess it was something to go on 

HEY IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
I SURE COULD USE THEM HERE RIGHT NOW 
WELL IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
WHERE DO WE GO 
(scat singing) 










tonight the moon is playing tricks again 
feeling sea sick again 
and the whole world could just dissolve into a glass of water 

I've been good 'cause I know you don't want me to 
do you really want me to be blue as you 
it's her daylight that gets me though 

we've been here before last time you scratched at my door 
the moon was naked and cold I was like a two year old 
who just wanted more 
if you wear that velvet dress but if you wear that velvet dress 
if you wear that velvet dress but if you wear that velvet dress 

tonight the moon has drawn its curtains 
(tonight the moon is a mirrorball) 
it's a private show no one else going to know 
(light flickers from across the hall I'm wanting) 
who'll catch the star when it falls 

sunlight sunlight fills my room if you wear that velvet dress 
it's sharp and it's clear 
but nothing at all like the moon 

it's okay the struggle for things not to say 
I never listened to you anyway 
and I got my own hands to pray 








Hard to tell 
Or recognize a sign 
To see me through 
A warning sign 

First the thunder Satisfied 
Then the storm If the past it will not lie 
Torn asunder The future, you and I 
In the storm Get blown away 

In a lifetime 
In a lifetime 

And as the rain it falls Begin again 
Heavy in my heart As the storm breaks through 
Believe the light in you So the light shines in you 
Faded and worn Without color 
Torn asunder in the storm Torn asunder in the storm 

Unless the sound has faded from your soul 
Unless it disappears 

First the thunder Selfish storm 
Then the storm Hold on the inside 
Torn asunder One life 
In the storm In the storm 

In a lifetime 
In a lifetime 
In a lifetime 
In a lifetime 








In a little while 
Surely you'll be mine 
In a little while I'll be there 


In a little while 
This hurt will hurt no more 
I'll be home, love 


When the night takes a deep breath 
And the daylight has no air 
If I crawl, if I come crawling home 
WiIl you be there 


In a little while 
I won't (be) blow by every breeze 
Friday night running 
To Sunday on my knees 


That girl, that girl 
She's mine 
And I've know her since 


Since you were a little girl 
With Spanish eyes 
Oh, when I saw her 
In a pram they pushed her by 


My, how you've grown 
Well it's been 
It's been a little while 


Slow down my beating heart 
Man dreams one day to fly 
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies 
He lives on a star that's dying in the night 
And follows in the trail 
The scatter of light 


Turn it on 
Turn it on 
You turn me on 


Slow down my beating heart 
Slowly, slowly love 
Slow down my beating heart 
Slowly, slowly love 
Slow down my beating heart 
Slowly, slowly love 









Yeah...

Desert sky
Dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight

Desert rose
Dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren she calls to me

Sleep comes like a drug
In God's Country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses
In God's Country

Yeah...yeah...

Set me alight
We'll punch a hole right through the night
Everyday the dreamers die
See what's on the other side

She is liberty
And she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold

Sleep comes like a drug
In God's Country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses
In God's Country

Yeah...

Naked flame
She stands with a naked flame
I stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love
Love....









Come to me 
Come lie beside me 
Oh don't deny me 
Your love 


Make sense of me 
Walk through my doorway 
Don't hide in the hallway 
Oh love...step over 


I'll follow you down 
I'll follow you down 


In the name of whiskey 
In the name of song 
You didn't look back 
You didn't belong 


In the name of reason 
In the name of hope 
In the name of religion 
In the name of dope 


In the name of freedom 
You drifted away 
To see the sun shining 
On someone else's day 


In the name of United and the BBC 
In the name of Georgie Best and LSD 


In the name of a father 
And his wife the spirit 
You said you did not 
They said you did it 


In the name of justice 
In the name of fun 
In the name of the father 
In the name of the son 


Call to me 
No one is listening 
I'm waiting to hear from you love 


Stay with me 
It's cold in the ground 
But there's peace in the sound 
Of the white and the black 
Spilling over 


I'll follow you down 
I'll follow you down 
I'll follow you down 







In the ocean 
Cut, swim, deep the sky 
Like there, I don't know why 
In the forest, there's a clearing 
I run there towards the light 
Sky... 
It's a blue sky... 

In the awful holding deep decide 
If I could, I would 
Up for air to swim against the tide 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Up toward the sky... 
It's a blue sky... 

To lose along the way 
The spark that set the flame 
To flicker and to fade 
On this the longest day 

So wind blow through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind blow through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind blow through to my heart... 

You give yourself to this the longest day 
You give yourself 
You give it all away 

Two rivers run too deep, the seasons change 
And so do I 
The light that strikes the tallest trees 
The light that wait for I 
The light...waiting 
Up toward the sky... 
It's a blue sky... 

To lose along the way 
The spark that set the flame 
To flicker and to fade 
On this the longest day 

So wind go through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind go through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind go through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind go through to my heart... 

You give yourself to this the longest day 
You give yourself 
You give it all away... 








Late at night 
When the motion beats down 
I feel so low, oh no 


I lived a lie 
For a thousand years 
We start to cower, oh no 


I said oh no, baby don't 
What you got to do it for 
Can't go on 


She says oh no, baby don't 
Let me take me out here 
Thank you man 


You can think your so high 
When the moon is way down low 
Take your time, feel fine 
Those ladies are so darn high 
Oh no no no 


You gamble inside out 
Forever inside out 







Into the heart...of a child 
I stay awhile...oh, I can go back 

Into the heart...of a child 
I can smile 
I can go there 

Into the heart 
Into the heart of a child 
I can go back 
I can stay awhile 

Into the heart 







Singing this song makes me angry 
I'm not angry with you 
Is that all 
Is that all 
Is that all 

Singing song that makes me happy 
I'm not happy with you 
Singing this song makes me pale 
Is that all 
Is that all 

Is that all 
Is that all 
Is that all 
Is that all you want from me 

Is that all 
Is that all 
Is that all 
Is that all 








Something 
Is about to give 
I can feel it coming 
I think I know what it means 


I'm not afraid to die 
I'm not afraid to live 
And when I'm flat on my back 
I hope to feel like I did 


And hardness 
It sets in 
You need some protection 
The thinner the skin 


I want you to know 
That you don't need me anymore 
I want you to know 
You don't need anyone 
Or anything at all 


Who's to say where the wind will take you 
Who's to say what it is will break you 
I don't know 
Which way the wind will blow 


Who's to know when the time has come around 
Don't want to see you cry 
I know that this is not goodbye 


It's summer, I can taste the salty sea 
There's a kite blowing out of control on the breeze 
I wonder what's gonna happen to you 
You wonder what has happened to me 


I'm a man 
I'm not a child 
A man who sees 
The shadow behind your eyes 


Who's to say where the wind will take you 
Who's to say what it is will break you 
I don't know 
Where the wind will blow 


Who's to know when the time has come around 
I don't want to see you cry 
I know that this is not goodbye 


Did I waste it 
Not so much I couldn't taste it 
Life should be fragrant 
Rooftop to the basement 


The last of the rocks stars 
When hip hop drove the big cars 
In the time when new media 
Was the big idea 
That was the big idea 







Here she comes 
Lady luck again 
Figure of eight 
Six and nine again 


I...I... 
My lady with the spinning head 


Whatever the deal 
She won't let me down 
Wherever I go 
She's always hanging 'round 


My lady with the spinning head 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
Lady with the spinning head 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
Lady with the spinning head 


She's been gone 
But I knew she'd be back 
She's got the rent 
She put me in the black 


I...I... 
The lady with the spinning head 


Mean old men 
Took away my car 
Those credit guys 
Have got the power 


I'm on top 
When she's around 
She's my ticket 
Out of town 


La la la la la la la la la la la 
Lady with the spinning head 
La la la la la la la la la la la 
Lady with the spinning head










She feels the ground is giving way 
But she thinks we're better off that way 
The more you take the less you feel 
The less you know the more you believe 
The more you have the more it takes today 


You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 
You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 
You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 


She knows just what she's worth 
She's living like it's the last night on earth 
The last night on earth 


She's not waiting on a saviour to come 
She's at the bus stop with News of the World and the Sun 
Sun, here it comes 
She's not waiting for anyone 


You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 
You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 
You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 


She don't care what it's worth 
But she's living like it's the last night on earth 
The last night on earth 




Slipping away 
Would you believe in something 
Would you believe in someone 


Slip slide 
She lets me 
Slipping away 

Would you believe in something 
Would you believe in someone 


The world turns 
And we get dizzy 
Slipping away 

Would you believe in something 
Would you believe in someone 



She's living, living next week now 
You know she's going to pay it back somehow 
She hasn't been to bed in a week 
She'll be dead soon then she'll sleep 


You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 
You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 
You got to give it away 
(You got to give it away) 


She already knows it hurts 
She's living like it's the last night on earth 
The last night on earth 
Last night on earth 
Last night... 









And the day is dry
And there's no water


And you can't see the road ahead
You can only see her


Why is it love...
You're holding on to all you say, girl
Why don't you cry, don't turn away
Away, lonesome love


Woman...
She's free, a woman, say
She hides behind you open
Woman...
She looks at me...


Woman...
She hides alone within, alone inside
She makes a mirror in, all around
All around, now
I'm only walking in her love


Woman...woman...
Girl that leave you, maybe woman
To turn you on and leave you on too high
We walk in love
We fall in love


Woman...


Empty heart


To turn you on and leave you on too high
To high, anymore
Your dark and cluttered heart
And there's a quietness that comes to this house
Where nobody can sleep



Lemon 
See through in the sunlight 
She wore lemon 
But never in the daylight 
She's gonna make you cry 
She's gonna make you whisper and moan 
And when you're dry 
She draws her water from the stone 

And I feel 
Like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under 
And I feel 
Like I'm holding onto nothing 

She wore lemon 
To colour in the cold grey night 
She had heaven 
And she held on so tight 

A man makes a picture 
A moving picture 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close 
A man captures colour 
A man likes to stare 
He turns his money into light to look for her 

And I feel 
Like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore 
And I feel 
Like I'm swimming out to her 

Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 

Lemon 
See through in the sunlight 

A man builds a city 
With banks and cathedrals 
A man melts the sand so he can 
See the world outside 
her there 
A man makes a car 
destination 
And builds roads to run them on 
A man dreams of leaving 
But he always stays behind 

And these are the days 
When our work has come assunder 
And these are the days 
When we look for something other 

Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 

Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 

A man makes a picture 
A moving picture 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close 
her there 
A man captures colour 
destination 
A man likes to stare 
there 
He turns his money into light 
To look for her 
She is the dreamer 
She's imagination 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close 







Like a song I hope to sing 
I sing it for you 
Like the words I have to bring 
I bring it for you 

And in leather, lace, and chains 
We stake our claim 
Revolution once again 
No I won't... 
I won't wear it on my sleeve 
I can see through this expression 
And you know I don't believe 
Too old to be told 
Exactly who are you 
Tonight 
Tomorrow's 
To late 

And we love to wear a badge, a uniform 
And we love to fly a flag 
But I won't...let others live in hell 
As we divide against each other 
And we fight amongst ourselves 
Too set in out ways to try to rearrange 
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song 
Let the bells ring out 
Let the bells ring out 
Is there nothing left? 
Is there, is there nothing? 
Is there nothing left? 
Is honesty what you want? 

A generation without name, ripped and torn 
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain 
Nothing at all 
And if you can't help yourself 
Well take a look around you 
When others need your time 
You say it's time to go...it's your time 
Angry words won't stop the fight 
Two wrongs won't make it right 
A new heart is what I need 
Oh God, make it bleed 
Is there nothing left... 







Life on a distant planet 
Another atmosphere 
Life on a distant planet 
So cold inside of here 


You can see her 
But she can't see you 
You can call her name 
But she won't even hear you 


In the morning of the day 
To the evening 
D day and beyond 


Lost on a silent planet 
Two lone, rising stars 
Locked on a silent planet 
So close and yet so far 


Children scream and shout 
Their eyes torn out 
Judith turns around and stumbles 
To the ground 


In the morning of the day 
The evening time 
D day and beyond 


Oh...girl you fall out 
Oh...girl you come out to cry 
Have you nothing to say 
Girl you come out to cry 
Have you nothing to say 


In the morning 
On to the day time 
To the evening 
D day and beyond 









The seed is split, the bed defiled
For you a virgin bride
Find yourself in someone else
Don't find yourself in me
I can't lift you up again
Love comes tumbling down again

Love don't need to find a way
You find your own way
I forget that I can't stay
And so I say that
All roads lead to where you are







Love don't need to find a way 
You find your own way 
I forget that I can't stay 
And so I say that 
All roads lead to where you are 
All roads lead to where you are 


The seed is spilled, the bed defiled 
For you, a virgin bride 
Hide yourself in someone else 
Don't find yourself in me 


I can't lift you up again 
Love comes tumbling down again 


Love don't need to find a way 
You find your own way 
I forget that you can stay 
And so I say that 
All roads lead to where you are 
All roads lead to where you are 








Love is blindness 
I don't wanna see 
Won't you wrap the night 
Around me? 
Oh my heart 
Love is blindness 

In a parked car 
In a crowded street 
You see your love 
Made complete 
Thread is ripping 
The knot is slipping 
Love is blindness 

Love is clockworks 
And cold steel 
Fingers too numb to feel 
Squeeze the handle 
Blow out the candle 
Love is blindness 

Love is blindness 
I don't want to see 
Won't you wrap the night 
Around me? 
Oh my love 
Blindness 

A little death 
Without mourning 
No call 
And no warning 
Baby, a dangerous idea 
That almost makes sense 

Love is drowning 
In a deep well 
All the secrets 
And no one to tell 
Take the money 
Honey 
Blindness 

Love is blindness 
I don't want to see 
Won't you wrap the night 
Around me? 
Oh my love 
Blindness 









Love rescue me 
Come forth and speak to me 
Raise me up and don't let me fall 
No man is my enemy 
My own hands imprison me 
Love rescue me 

Many strangers have I met 
On the road to my regret 
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me 
They ask me to reveal 
The very thoughts they would conceal 
Love rescue me 

And the sun in the sky 
Makes a shadow of you and I 
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea 
I'm here without a name 
In the palace of my shame 
Said, love rescue me 

In the cold mirror of a glass 
I see my reflection pass 
See the dark shades of what I used to be 
See the purple of her eyes 
The scarlet of my lies 
Love rescue me 

Yeah, though I walk 
In the valley of shadow 
Yeah, I will fear no evil 

I have cursed thy rod and staff 
They no longer comfort me 
Love rescue me 

Sha la la...sha la la la 
Sha la la la...sha la la... 
Sha la la la...sha la la la 
Sha la la la...sha la la 
Sha la la la...sha la la la 
Sha la la... 

I said love, love rescue me 

I said love 
Climb up the moutains, said love 
I said love, oh my love 
On the hill of the son 
I'm on the eve of a storm 
And my word you must believe in 
Oh, I said love, rescue me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah... 

Yeah I'm here without a name 
In the palace of my shame 
I said love rescue me 

I've conquered my past 
The future is here at last 
I stand at the entrance 
To a new world I can see 
The ruins to the right of me 
Will soon have lost sight of me 
Love rescue me 







Hey...sister love 
Hey...sister soul 
Hey...oh my love 
You turn me around tonight 
Hey...sister love 
Save my soul, save my soul 


Hold on to love, hold on to love 
Love won't let you go 
Love won't let you go 
Hold on to love 
See the sunshine in her soul 


Hey...sister love 
Hey...seems so bright 
She comes like carnival 
She is the big wheel 
She turned my head around 
Turned my head around 
She is the speedway 
She is the slipstream 
She is coming 'round 


Hold on to love 
Hold on to love 
Love won't let you go 
Hold on to love 
Hold on to love 
She the sunlight in her song 
See the sunlight in her soul 


She is the gun fire 
She is the car crash 
She is a avalanche 
She is the thunder 
She is the waves and 
She pulls me under 


I love you 'cause I need to 
Not because I need you 
I love you 'cause I understand 
That God has given me your hand 
He holds me in a tiny fist 
And still I need your kiss 


Hold...on to love 
Hold... 


See the sunlight in her song 
See the sunlight in her soul 







weather 'round here choppin' and changin' 
surgery in the air 
print shirts and southern accents 
cigars and big hair 
we got the wheels and petrol is cheap 
only went there for a week 
got the sun got the sand 
got the batteries in the handycam 

her eyes all swimming pool blue 
dumb bells on a diving board 
baby's always attracted to the things she's afraid of 
big girl with the sweet tooth 
watches the skinny girl in the photo shoot 
freshmen squeaky clean 
she tastes of chlorine 
MIAMI MY MAMMY 

love the movies love to walk those movie sets 
get to shoot someone in the foot 
get to smoke some cigarettes 
no big deal we know the score 
just back from the video store 
got the car and the car chase 
what's he got inside the case 
I want a close up of that face 
her comes the car chase 

MIAMI MY MAMMY 
MIAMI 

I bought two new suits miami 
pink aND BLUE MIAMI 
I TOOK A PICTURE OF YOU miami 
getting hot in a photo booth miami 
I said you looked like a madonna 
you said maybe and I went to have your baby BABY 
WE COULD MAKE something beautiful 
something that wouldn't be a problem 
at least not in miami 

some places are like your auntie 
but there's no place like 
MIAMI MY MAMMY 







Is there a time for keeping your distance 
A time to turn your eyes away 
Is there a time for keeping your head down 
For getting on with your day 


Is there a time for kohl and lipstick 
A time for cutting hair 
Is there a time for high street shopping 
To find the right dress to wear 


Here she comes 
Heads turn around 
Here she comes 
To take her crown 


Is there a time to run for cover 
A time for kiss and tell 
Is there a time for different colours 
Different names you find it hard to spell 


Is there a time for first communion 
A time for East 17 
Is there a time to turn to Mecca 
Is there time to be a beauty queen 


Here she comes 
Beauty plays the clown 
Here she comes 
Surreal in her crown 


Dici che il fiume 
Trova la via al mare 
E come il fiume 
Giungerai a me 
Oltre i confini 
E le terre assetate 
Dici che come fiume 
Come fiume... 
L'amore giunger 
L'amore... 
E non so pi pregare 
E nell'amore non so pi sperare 
E quell'amore non so pi aspettare 

Is there a time for tying ribbons 
A time for Christmas trees 
Is there a time for laying tables 
And the night is set to freeze







Sleep
Sleep tonight
And may your dreams
Be realized
If the thunder cloud
Passes rain
So let it rain
Rain down on him
Mmm...mmm...mmm...
So let it be
Mmm...mmm...mmm...
So let it be

Sleep
Sleep tonight
And may your dreams
Be realized
If the thundercloud
Passes rain
So let it rain
Let it rain
Rain on him

lookin' in the places where no flowers grow 
lookin' for to fill that GOD shaped hold 

mother mother sucking rock and roll

Midnight, our sons and daughters 
Were cut down and taken from us 
Hear their heartbeat 
We hear their heartbeat 

In the wind we hear their laughter 
In the rain we see their tears 
Hear their heartbeat 
We hear their heartbeat 

Night hangs like a prisoner 
Stretched over black and blue 
Hear their heartbeat 
We hear their heartbeat 

In the trees our sons stand naked 
Through the walls our daughters cry 
See their tears in the rainfall 






Johnny take a walk with your sister the moon 
Let her pale light in to fill up your room 
You've been living underground 
Eating from a can 
You've been running away 
From what you don't understand: 
Love 

She's slippy 
Your're sliding down 
She'll be there when you hit the ground 

It's alright, it's alright, alright 
She moves in mysterious ways 
It's alright, it's alright, alright 
She moves in mysterious ways 
Ah...ah...ah... 

Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain 
Let her talk about the things you can't explain 
To touch is to heal 
To hurt is to steal 
If you wanna kiss the sky 
Better learn how to kneel 
On your knees boy! 

She's the wave 
She turns the tide 
She sees a man inside the child 

It's alright, it's alright, alright 
She moves in mysterious ways 
It's alright, it's alright, alright 
She moves in mysterious ways 
It's alright, it's alright, alright 
Lift my days, light up my nights 

One day you will look back 
And you'll see 
Where you were held 
How? By this love 
While you could stand there 
You could move on this moment 
Follow this feeling 

It's alright, it's alright, alright 
She moves in mysterious ways 
It's alright, it's alright, alright 
She moves in mysterious ways 
It's alright, it's alright, alright 

We move through miracle days 
Spirit moves in mysterious ways 
She moves with it 
She moves with it 
Lift my days, light up my nights 













All is quiet on New Year's Day,
A world in white gets underway,
And I want to be with you,
Be with you night and day.
Nothing changes on New Year's Day.
I will be with you again.
I will be with you again.

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white.
Arms entwined, the chosen few,
Newspapers say, it says it's true.
And we can break through,
though torn in two we can be one.
I will begin again, I will begin again.
Oh and maybe the time is right,
Oh maybe tonight.
I will be with you again.
I will be with you again.







In New York freedom looks like 
Too many choices 
In New York I found a friend 
To drown out the other voices 


Voices on a cell phone 
Voices from home 
Voices of the hard sell 
Voices down a stairwell 
In New York 
Just got a place in New York 


In New York summers get hot 
Well into the hundreds 
You can walk around the block 
Without a change of clothing 


Hot as a hair dryer in your face 
Hot as handbag and a can of mace 
New York 
I just got a place in New York 


New York New York 

In New York you can forget 
Forget how to sit still 
Tell yourself you will stay in 
But it's down to Alphaville 


New York 
New York, New York 


New York, New York 
New York 


The Irish been coming here for years 
Feel like they own the place 
They got the airport, city hall 
Asphalt, asphalt 
They even got the police 


Irish, Italians, Jews and Hispanics 
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew 
Happily not like me and you 
That's where I lost you 


New York 
New York, New York 
New York 
New York, New York 


New York 
New York 


In New York I lost it all 
To you and your vices 
Still I'm staying on to figure out 
My midlife crisis 


I hit an iceberg in my life 
You know I'm still afloat 
You lose your balance, lose your wife 
In the queue for the lifeboat 


You got to put the women and children first 
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York 


New York 
New York 
New York, New York 


In the stillness of the evening 
When the sun has had its day 
I heard your voice whispering 
Come away now 


New, New York 
New... 
New York 


New York 






When the jungle shadows fall 
Like the tick tick tock of the eye of the clock 
As it's standing against the wall 
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops 
When the summer shower's through 
So a voice within me 
Keeps revealing you...you 


Night and day 
You are the one 
Only you beneath the moon 
And under the sun 
Whether near to me or far 
It's no matter, baby, where you are 
I think of you 
Night and day 


Day and night 
Why is it so 
That this longing for you follows wherever I go 
In the roaring traffic gloom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you 
Night and day 


Night and day 
Under the hide of me 
Though such a hungry yearning 
Burning inside of me 
This torment won't be through 
'til you let me spend my life making love to you 
Day and night 
Night and day 


Night and day 
Under the hide of me 
Oh, such a hungry yearning 
Burning, burning inside of me 
This torment won't be through 
'til you let me spend my life making love to you 
Day and night 
Night and day 


Night and day 
Night and day 
Night and day 
Night, night, night and day 
Night and day 
Night, night and day 
Night and day 







City street lights 
And the multiple life 
But babe you gotta give and go 


Cigarette lights 
Then my finger alights 
I need to be alone 


She can take you tonight 
She can make you, that's alright 
She can break you tonight 
Don't misunderstand 


Cigarette girls 
Goes head in and whirls 
You will be a superman 


Open her booths 
Deal must to the bruiser 
Drinking all I can 


We can take that tonight 
We can make them, that's right 
We can break them tonight 
Don't misunderstand 


The light... 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea of pain 


You can take it tonight 
She can make you, that's right 
She can break you tonight 
Don't misunderstand 
'cause they cry, and... 


Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea at night 


We rode the streets in the morning light 
We held our day in our hands 


Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea at night 





I want to reach out over the Loch 
And feel your hand across the water 
Walk with you along an unapproved road 
Not looking over my shoulder 


I want to see, and I want to hear 
To understand your fears 
But we're north and south of the river 


I've been doing it wrong all of my life 
This holy town has turned me over 
A young man running from what he didn't understand 
The wind from the Loch just get colder, colder 


There was a badness that had its way 
But love wasn't lost, love will have its day 
North and south of the river 
North and south of the river 


Can we stop playing these old tattoos 
Darling I don't have the answer 
I want to meet you where you are 
I don't need you to surrender 


'Cause there's no feeling that's so alone 
As when the one you're hurting is your own 
North and south of the river 
North and south of the river 
North and south of the river 


Some high ground is not worth taking 
Some connections are not worth making 
There's an old church bell no longer ringing 
Some old songs are not worth bringing 
North... 
(Higher ground is not worth taking) 
North and south of the river

Don't fill out any forms 
Don't compensate 
Don't cower 
Don't crawl 
Don't come around late 
Don't hover at the gate 

Don't take it on board 
Don't fall on your sword 
Just play another chord 
If you feel you're getting bored

October 
And the trees are stripped bare 
Of all they wear 
What do I care 


October 
And kingdoms rise 
And kingdoms fall 
But you go on...and on...








Is it getting better? 
Or do you feel the same? 
Will it make it easier on you now? 
You got someone to blame 
You say 

One love 
One life 
When it's one need 
In the night 
One love 
We get to share it 
Leaves you baby if you 
Don't care for it 

Did I disappoint you? 
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth? 
You act like you never had love 
And you want me to go without 
Well it's 

Too late 
Tonight 
To drag the past out into the light 
We're one, but we're not the same 
We get to 
Carry each other 
Carry each other 
One 

Have you come here for forgiveness? 
Have you come to raise the dead? 
Have you come here to play Jesus? 
To the lepers in your head 

Did I ask too much? 
More than a lot. 
You gave me nothing, 
Now it's all I got 
We're one 
But we're not the same 
Well we 
Hurt each other 
Then we do it again 
You say 
Love is a temple 
Love a higher law 
Love is a temple 
Love the higher law 
You ask me to enter 
But then you make me crawl 
And I can't be holding on 
To what you got 
When all you got is hurt 

One love 
One blood 
One life 
You got to do what you should 
One life 
With each other 
Sisters 
Brothers 
One life 
But we're not the same 
We get to 
Carry each other 
Carry each other 

One 

One 








We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill 
As the day begs the night for mercy love 
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows 
Only scars 
Carved into stone 
On the face of earth 
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill 
We see the sun go down in your eyes 

You run like river, on like a sea 
You run like a river runs to the sea 

And in the world a heart of darkness 
A fire zone 
Where poets speak their heart 
Then bleed for it 
Jara sang his song a weapon 
In the hands of love 
You know his blood still cries 
From the ground 

It runs like a river runs to the sea 
It runs like a river to the sea 

I don't believe in painted roses 
Or bleeding hearts 
While bullets rape the night of the merciful 
I'll see you again 
When the stars fall from the sky 
And the moon has turned red 
Over One Tree Hill 

We run like a river 
Run to the sea 
We run like a river to the sea 
And when it's raining 
Raining hard 
That's when the rain will 
Break my heart 

Raining...raining in the heart 
Raining in your heart 
Raining...raining to your heart 
Raining, raining...raining 
Raining to your heart 
Raining...raining in your heart 
Raining in your heart.. 
To the sea 

Oh great ocean 
Oh great sea 
Run to the ocean 
Run to the sea 







Monday morning 
Eighteen years of dawning 
I say how long? 
You say how long? 

It was one dull morning 
Woke the world with falling 
I was so sad, so sad 
It was so bad, so bad 

I was of a feeling it was out of control 
I had the opinion it was out of control 

Boys and Girls 
Go to the school and girls 
They make children 
Not like this one 

I was of a feeling it was out of control 
I had the opinion it was out of control 

I was of a feeling it was out of control 
I had the opinion it was out of control 

Out of control...out of control...out of control...out of control...out of control... 

I fought fate 
There's blood on the garden gate 
The man says childhood 
It's in his childhood 

One day I'll die 
The choice will not be mine 
Will it be too late 
You can't fight it 

I was of a feeling it was out of control 
I had the opinion it was out of control 








I see a red door 
And I want it painted black 
No colors anymore 
I want them to turn black 
I see the girls walk by 
Dressed in their summer clothes 
I have to turn my head 
Until my darkness goes 


I see a line of cars 
And they're all painted black 
With flowers and my love 
Both never to come back 
I see them turn their heads 
Quickly look away 
Like a newborn baby 
It just happens every day 


I look inside my self 
See my heart is back 
I see my red door 
And I want it painted black 
Maybe then I'll fade away 
And not have to face the facts 
It's not easy facing up 
When your whole world is black 


No more will my green sea 
Go turn a deeper blue 
I could not foresee 
This thing happening to you. 
If I look hard enough 
Into the setting sun, 
My love will laugh with me 
Before the morning comes 


Wanna see it painted 
Painted it black 
Love is gone 








Heaven on Earth 
We need it now 
I'm sick of all of this 
Hanging around 


Sick of sorrow 
I'm sick of the pain 
I'm sick of hearing 
Again and again 
That there's gonna be 
Peace on Earth 


Where I grew up 
There weren't many trees 
Where there was we'd tear them down 
And use them on our enemies 


They say that what you mock 
Will surely overtake you 
And you become a monster 
So the monster will not break you 


And it's already gone too far 
Who said that if you go in hard 
You won't get hurt 


Jesus can you take the time 
To throw a drowning man a line 
Peace on Earth 


Tell the ones who hear no sound 
Whose sons are living in the ground 
Peace on Earth 


No whos or whys 
No one cries like a mother cries 
For peace on Earth 


She never got to say goodbye 
To see the color in his eyes 
Now he's in the dirt 
Peace on Earth 


They're reading names out 
Over the radio 
All the folks the rest of us 
Won't get to know 


Sean and Julia 
Gareth, Ann, and Breda 
Their lives are bigger than 
Any big idea 


Jesus can you take the time 
To throw a drowning man a line 
Peace on Earth 


To tell the ones who hear no sound 
Whose sons are living in the ground 
Peace on Earth 


Jesus in this song you wrote 
The words are sticking in my throat 
Peace on Earth 


Hear it every Christmas time 
But hope and history won't rhyme 
So what's it worth 


This peace on Earth 
Peace on Earth 
Peace on Earth 
Peace on Earth 







so you never knew love until you crossed the line of grace 
and you never felt wanted till you had someone slap your face 
so you never felt alive until you almost wasted away 

you had to win 
you couldn't just pass 
the smartest ass 
at the top of the class 
your flying colours 
your family tree 
and all your lessons in history 

please please please get up off your knees please please leave me out of this 

please 

and you never knew how low you'd stoop to make that call 
and you never knew what was on the ground till they made you crawl 
and you never knew that the heaven you keep you stole 

your catholic blues 
your convent shoes 
your stick on tatoos 
now they're making the news 
your holy war 
your northern star 
your sermon on the mount 
from the boot of your car 
please please please get up off your knees please please leave me out of this 

please 
so love is hard and love is tough 
but love is not what you're thinking of 

september streets capsizing spilling over down the drain 
shards of glass splinters like rain but you could only feel your own pain 
october talking getting nowhere november december remember 
are we just starting again? 

so love is big bigger than us 
but love is not what you're thinking of 
IT'S what lovers deal it's what lovers steal 
you know I've found it hard to receive 
'cause you my love I could never believe 










One man come in the name of love 
One man come and go 
One man come he to justify 
One man to overthrow 

In the name of love! 
What more in the name of love? 
In the name of love! 
What more? In the name of love! 

One man caught on a barbed wire fence 
One man he resist 
One man washed on an empty beach 
One man betrayed with a kiss 

In the name of love! 
What more in the name of love? 
In the name of love! 
What more? In the name of love! 

Yes! 

Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh... 
Early morning, April 4 
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky 
Free at last, they took your life 
They could not take your pride 

In the name of love! 
What more in the name of love? 
In the name of love! 
What more in the name of love? 

Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...oh... 

For the reverend Martin Luther King, sing! 

In the name of love! 
What more in the name of love? 
In the name of love! 
What more in the name of love 

In the name of love... 







Earth, sky, sea, and rain 
Is she coming back again? 
Men of straw sneak a whore 
Words that build or destroy 
Dirt, dry, bone, sand, and stone 

Barbed wire fence cut me down 
I'd like to be around 
In a spiral staircase 
To the higher ground 

And I, like a firework, explode 
Roman candle lightning lights up the sky 

In the cracked streets trampled under foot 
Sidestep...sidewalk 
I see you stare...into space 
Have I got closer now? 
Behind the face 

Oh...tell me... 
Charity dance with me 
Turn me around tonight 
Up though a spiral staircase 
To the higher ground 

Slide show, sea side town 
Coca cola football radio radio radio... 









From father to son 
The blood runs thin 
Oooh....see faces frozen still 
Against the wind 

The seam is split 
The coal face cracked 
The lines are long 
There's no going back 
Through hands of steel 
And heart of stone 
Our labour day 
Has come and gone 

Yeah, you leave me holding on 
In Red Hill Town 
See lights go down 

I'm hangin' on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
I'm still waiting 
I'm hangin' on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 

The glass is cut 
The bottle run dry 
Our love runs cold 
In the caverns of the night 
We're wounded by fear 
Injured in doubt 
I can lose myself 
You I can't live without 

Yeah, you keep me holding on 
In Red Hill Town 
See the lights go down on 
I'm hanging on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
I'm still waiting 
Hanging on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
On to... 

We'll scorch the earth 
Set fire to the sky 
We stoop so low 
To reach so high 
A link is lost 
The chain undone 
We wait all day 
For night to come 
And it comes 
Like a hunter child 

I'm hanging on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
I'm still waiting 
I'm hanging on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 

Love 
Slowly stripped away 
Love 
Has seen its better day 

Hanging on 
Let's go out on Red Hill 
Let's go down on Red Hill 
Let's go down on Red Hill Town 
Let's go down on Red Hill 







I talk to you 
You walk away 
You're still on the down beat 
You say you don't want my help 
But you get hurt, scared 
If your running from yourself 

I give you my love 
I give you my love 
Give you my love 
Still you walk away 

It's your own late show 
As you jump to the street below 
But where can you go 
To leave yourself behind 
Alone in the spotlight 
Of this, your own tragedy 

I give you my love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love, love, love... 

In the heart in the heart 
In the heart of the city 
Heart in the heart in 
The heart of the city 
Oh, love... 
I pour my love out for you 
And I'll bring you through 
See your not alone 

I give you my love, give you my love 
Give you my love, give you my love 
Give you my love, give you my love 
Give you my love, give you my love 
Give you my love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love, love... 






Ah... 
It's falling, it's falling 
And outside a building 
Comes tumbling down 
Inside a child on the ground 
Says he'll do it again 

And what am I to do 
What in the world am I to say there's nothing else to do 
He says he'll change the world someday 
I rejoice 

He's building, I'll follow 
In my bed when I woke up 
To what he has said 
Maybe it's grazy 
But I'm too lazy to lie 

And what am I to do 
Just tell me what am I supposed to say I can't change the world, 
But I can change the world in me 
If I rejoice 
Rejoice 

And what am I to do 
Just tell me what am I supposed to say I can't change the world, 
But I can change the world in me 
If I rejoice 

I don't know what to change 
Rejoice...rejoice...rejoice...rejoice...rejoice...rejoice...rejoice... 







And so she woke up 
Woke up from where she was 
Lying still 
Said I gotta do something 
About where we're going 

Step on a steam train 
Step out of the driving rain, maybe 
Run from the darkness in the night 
Singing Ha, Ah La La La De Day 
Ah La La La De Day 
Ah La La De Day 

Sweet the sin 
Bitter taste in my mouth 
I see seven towers 
But I only see one way out: 
You gotta cry without weeping 
Talk without speaking 
Scream without raising your voice 

You know I took the poison 
From the poison stream 
Then I floated out of here 
Singing...Ha La La La De Day 
Ha La La La De Day 
Ha La La De Day 

Ooooh...Ooooh...Ooooh... 

She runs through the streets 
With her eyes painted red 
Under black belly of cloud in the rain 
In through a doorway she brings me 
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea 
She is raging 
She is raging 
And the storm blows up in her eyes 

She will... 
Suffer the needle chill 

She is running to stand... 
Still 







Baby please 
Baby please don't go 
I got lies to feed 
They want skin and seed 
And don't make me crawl 


Please 
Baby don't bite your lip 
Give you half what I got 
If you untie the knot 
It's a promise 


Salome...salome 
Shake it shake it shake it salome 
Shake it shake it shake it salome 
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome 


Baby please 
Baby what's that tune 
Well I heard it before 
When I crawled from your door 
And my blood turned blue 


Please 
Baby please slow down 
Baby I feel sick 
Don't make me stick to my promise 


Salome...salome 
Shake it shake it shake it salome 
Shake it shake it shake it salome 
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome 
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome 


Baby please 
Baby don't say no 
Won't you dance for me 
Under the cherry tree 
Won't you swing down low 


Please 
Baby please say yes 
Baby don't go away 
You're spilling me 
And your precious love 


Salome...salome 
Shake it shake it shake it salome 
Shake it shake it shake it salome 
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome 
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome 
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome 









Satellite's gone 
Up to the sky 
Things like that drive me 
Out of my mind 
I watched it for a little while 
I love to watch things on TV 


Oh...satellite of love 
Ah...satellite of love 
Oo...satellite of love 
Satellite 


Satellite's gone 
Way up to Mars 
Soon it will be filled 
With parking cars 
I watched it for a little while 
I love to watch things on TV 


Ooo...ahh...satellite of love 
Ha...satellite of love 
Satellite of love 
Satellite 


I've been told that you've been bold 
With Harry, Mark, and John 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday 
Harry, Mark, and John 


Satellite's gone 
Up to the sky 
Things like that drive me 
Out of my mind 
I watched it for a little while 
I love to watch things on TV 


Hoo...satellite of love 
Haa...satellite of love 
Hoo...satellite of love 
Satellite of... 


Satellite...satellite...
Satellite...satellite...
Satellite...satellite...








Takes a second to say goodbye 
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh 
It takes a second to say goodbye 
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh, say bye bye 
Where you going to now 

Lightning flashes across the sky 
East to west, do or die 
Like a thief in the night 
See the world by candlelight 

Fall, rise and...fall, rise and... 

In an apartment on Time Square 
You can assemble them anywhere 
Held to ransom, hell to pay 
A revolution everyday 
USSR, DDR, London, New York, Peking 
It's the puppets, it's the puppets 
Who pull the strings 

Fall, rise and...fall, rise and... 

Say goodbye, say goodbye 
Say goodbye, say goodbye 
Say goodbye 

It takes a second to say goodbye 
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh 

Push the button and pull the plug 
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh 

Fall, rise and...fall, rise and... 

And they're doing the atomic bomb 
Do they know where the dance comes from 
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb 
They want you to sing along 
Say goodbye, say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye 







Back to the cold restless streets at night 
I talk to myself about tomorrow night 
Walls of white protest 
A gravestone in name 
Who is it now 
It's always the same 

Who is it now 
Who calls me inside 
Are the leaves on the trees 
Just a living disguise 
I walk the sweet rain tragicomedy 
I'll walk home again 
To the street melody 

But I know, oh no 
But I know, oh no 
But I know 

Shadows and tall trees 
Shadows and tall trees 
Shadows and tall trees 
Shadows and tall trees 

Life through a window 
Discoloured pain 
Mrs. Brown's washing is always the same 
I walk street rain tragicomedy 
I'll walk home again 
To the street melody 

But I know, oh no 
But I know, oh no 
But I know 

...out there... 

Do you feel in me 
Anything redeeming 
Any worthwhile feeling 
Is life like a tightrope 
Hanging from the ceiling 

But I know, oh no 
But I know, oh no 
But I know 

Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadow...shadow...shadow 
Shadow...shadow...shadow 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Don't be my shadow...shadow...shadow 
It's only my shadow...shadow...shadow 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 






Darkness falls and she 
Will take me by the hand 
Take me to some twilight land 
Where all but love is gray 
Where I can find my way 
Without her as my guide 


Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell 
Daylight falls, our heaven turns to hell 
Am I left to burn 
And burn eternally 
She's a mystery to me 


She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 


In the night of love 
Words tangled in her hair 
Words soon to disappear 
A love so sharp it cut 
Like a switchblade to my heart 
Words tearing me apart 


She tears again my bleeding heart 
I want to run, she's pulling me apart 
Fallen angel cries 
Then I just melt away 
She's a mystery girl 


She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 


Haunted by her side 
It's a darkness in her eyes 
That so enslaves me 
And if my love is blind 
Then I don't want to see 
She's a mystery to me 


Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell 
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell 
Am I left to burn 
And burn eternally 
She's a mystery to me 


She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 


She's...a mystery girl 
Mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's...a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 









In the shit house a shotgun 
Praying hands hold me down 
Only the hunter was hunted 
In this tin can town 
Tin can town 


No stars in the black night 
Looks like the sky fell down 
No sun in the daylight 
Looks like it's chained to the ground 
Chained to the ground 
The warden said 
The exit is sold 
If you want a way out 
Silver and gold 


Broken back to the ceiling 
Broken nose to the floor 
I scream at the silence, it's crawling 
It crawls under the door 
There's a rope around my neck 
And there's a trigger in your gun 
Jesus say something 
I am someone, I am someone 
I am someone 


Captain and kings 
In the ships hold 
They came to collect 
Silver and gold 
Silver and gold 


Seen the coming and going 
Seen them captains and the kings 
See them navy blue uniforms 
See them bright and shiny things 
Bright shiny things 


The temperature is rising 
The fever white hot 
Mister, I ain't got nothing 
But it's more than you got 


Chains no longer bind me 
Not the shackles at my feet 
Outside are the prisoners 
Inside the free 
Set them free 
Set them free 


A prize fighter in a corner is told 
Hit where it hurts 
Silver and gold 
Silver and gold 







My love is cruel as the night 
She steals the sun, and shuts out the light 
All of my colors, they turn to blue 
Win or lose 


She does it slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She does it slow...dancing 
All night long 


Scarlet eyes and a see through heart 
She saw me coming right from the start 
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees 
Just a' beggin' her, beggin' her please 


Take me slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She took me slow...dancing 
All night long 


And I don't know why a man 
Search for himself in his lover's eyes 
No I don't know why a man 
Sees the truth but needs the lies 


My love is restless as the wind 
She moves like a shadow across my skin 
She left with my conscience, I don't want it back 
It just gets in the way 


If you wanna go slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She took me slow...dancing 
All night long 


Slow...dancing 
Slow...dancing 
Slow... 







We crossed the line 
Who pushed who over? 
It doesn't matter to you 
It matters to me 

We're cut adrift 
We're still floating 
I'm only hanging on 
To watch you go down 
My love 

I disappeared in you 
You disappeared from me 
I gave you everything you ever wanted 
It wasn't what you wanted 

The men who love you, you hate the most 
They pass through you like a ghost 
They look for you, but your spirit is in the air 
Baby, you're nowhere 

Oh...love... 
You say in love there are no rules 
Oh...love... 
Sweetheart, 
You're so cruel 

Desparation is a tender trap 
It gets you every time 
You put your lips to her lips 
To stop the lie 

Her skin is pale like God's only dove 
Screams like an angel for your love 
Then she makes you watch her from above 
And you need her like a drug 

Oh...love... 
You say in love there are no rules 
Oh...love... 
Sweetheart, 
You're so cruel 

She wears my love like a see through dress 
Her lips say one thing 
Her movements something else 
Oh love, like a screaming flower 
Love...dying every hour...love 

You don't know if it's fear or desire 
Danger the drug that takes you higher 
Head in heaven, fingers in the mire 

Her heart is racing, you can't keep up 
The night is bleeding like a cut 
Between the horses of love and lust 
We are trampled underfoot 

Oh...love... You say in love there are no rules 
Oh...love... 
Sweetheart, 
You're so cruel 

Oh...love... 
To stay with you I'd be a fool 
Sweetheart 
You're so cruel 








Some days are dry, some days are leaky 
Some days come clean, other days are sneaky 
Some days take less, but most days take more 
Some slip through your fingers and onto the floor 

Some days you're quick, but most days you're speedy 
Some days you use more force than is necessary 
Some days just drop in on us 
Some days are better than others 

Some days it all adds up 
And what you got is not enough 
Some days are better than others 

Some days are slippy, other days sloppy 
Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy 
Your skin is white but you think you're a brother 
Some days are better than others 

Some days you wake up with her complaining 
Some sunny days you wish it was raining 
Some days are sulky, some days have a grin 
And some days have bouncers and won't let you in 

Some days you hear a voice 
Taking you to another place 
Some days are better than others 

Some days are honest, some days are not 
Some days you're thankful for what you've got 
Some days you wake up in the army 
And some days it's the enemy 

Some days are work, most days you're lazy 
Some days you feel like a bit of a baby 
Lookin' for Jesus and His mother 
Some days are better than others 

Some days you feel ahead 
You're making sense of what she said 
Some days are better than others 

Some days you hear a voice 
Taking you to another place 
Some days are better than others 







Wey hey hey, baby hang on 
Wey hey hey, baby hang on 
Empty heart, beat tight as a drum set 
Empty love, she'd shine like a song 
Wey hey hey, baby hang on (to anything) 


Our love shines like rain 
In those spanish eyes 
Spanish eyes 


Wey hey hey, here she comes 
She comes in colors 
You know she gonna turn the daylight on 
'cause I love the way you talk to me 
And I love the way you walk on me 
And I need you more 
Oh, than you need me 


Our love shines like rain 
In those spanish eyes 
Spanish eyes 


I'll cross the world for green and gold 
But it's those Spanish eyes 
That get me home...home again 


Wey hey hey, baby hang on 
Wey hey hey, you know that 
The night is young 
Dazzled by lights that shine in your eyes 
I'm standing in the shadows 
And wait for the night 
Forever in fever, forever in heat 
You pick me up to put me out on the street 


Wey hey hey, baby hang on, hang on 
Wey hey hey, baby hang on, hang on 
'cause I love the way you talk to me 
And I love the way you're mean to me 
And I need you 








In the town of Springhill Nova Scotia 
Down in the dark of the Cumberland mine 
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie 
In roads that never saw sun or sky 
Roads 




In the town of Springhill 
They don't sleep easy 
Often the earth will tremble and roll 
When the earth is restless 
Miners die 


Bone and blood is the price of coal 
Bone and blood is the price of coal 


Listen to the shouts of the black faced miner 
Listen to the call of the rescue team 
We have no water, light or bread 
So we're living on songs and hope instead 
Living on songs and hope instead 


In the town of Springhill Nova Scotia 
Down in the dark of the Cumberland mine 
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie 
In roads that never saw sun or sky 
Roads that never saw sun nor sky 


In the town of Springhill 
Don't sleep easy 
Often the earth will tremble and roll 
When the earth is restless 
Miners die 


Bone and blood is the price of coal 
Bone and blood is the price of coal 
Bone and blood is the price of coal 







SUMMER stretching on the grass summer dresses pass 
in the shade of a willow tree creeps a crawling over me 
over me and over you stuck together with God's glue 
it's going to get stickier too 
it's been a long hot summer 
let's get undercover 
don't try too hard to think don't think at all 

I'm not the only one starin' at the sun 
afraid of what you'd find if you took a look inside 
not just deaf and dumb I'm staring at the sun 
not the only one who's happy to go blind 

there's an insect in your ear if you scratch it won't disappear 
it's gonna itch and burn and sting 
do you want to see what the scratching brings 
waves that leave me out of reach 
breaking on your back like a beach 
will we ever live in peace? 
'cause those that can't do often have to 
those that can't do often have to preach 

to the ones staring at the sun 
afraid of what you'll find if you took a look inside 
not just deaf and dumb staring at the sun 
I'm not the only one who'd rather go blind 

intransigence is all around military still in town 
armour plated suits and ties daddy just won't say goodbye 
referee won't blow the whistle God is good but will HE listen 
I'm nearly great 
but there's something I'm missing I left in the duty free 
though you never really belonged to me 

you're not the only one starin' at the sun 
afraid of what you'd find if you stepped back inside 
I'm not sucking my thumb I'm staring at the sun 
not the only one who's happy to go blind 









Green light, Seven Eleven 
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
You don't smoke, don't even want to 
Hey now, check your change 
Dressed up like a car crash 
Your wheels are turning but you're upside down 
You say when he hits you, you don't mind 
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive 
Hey babe, is that what it is 

Red lights, gray morning 
You stumble out of a hole in the ground 
A vampire or a victim 
It depend's on who's around 
You used to stay in to watch the adverts 
You could lip synch to the talk shows 

And if you look, you look through me 
And when you talk, you talk at me 
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing 

If I could stay... 
Then the night would give you up 
Stay...and the day would keep its trust 
Stay...and the night would be enough 

Faraway, so close 
Up with the static and the radio 
With satelite television 
You can go anywhere 
Miami, New Orleans 
London, Belfast and Berlin 

And if you listen I can't call 
And if you jump, you just might fall 
And if you shout, I'll only hear you 

If I could stay... 
Then the night would give you up 
Stay...then the day would keep its trust 
Stay...with the demons you drowned 
Stay...with the spirit I found 
Stay...and the night would be enough 

Three o'clock in the morning 
It's quiet and there's no one around 
Just the bang and the clatter 
As an angel runs to ground 

Just the bang 
And the clatter 
As an angel 
Hits the ground 







There's a place I go 
And I am far away 
There's a TV show 
And I can grow 

Sometimes the hero takes me 
Sometimes I don't let go 
Hello, hello 

There's a picture book 
With colored photographs 
There's a comic strip 
That makes me laugh 

Sometimes the lady takes me 
Sometimes I don't let go 
Hello, hello 

Stories for boys 
Stories for boys 
Stories for boys 
Stories for boys 
Stories for boys 

There's a place I go 
And it's a part of me 
There's a radio 
And I will crawl 

Sometimes the hero takes me 
Sometimes I can't let go 
Hello, hello 

Stories for boys...stories for boys...stories for boys... 
Stories for boys...stories for boys...stories for boys... 
Stories for boys...stories for boys 







Stranger 
Stranger in a stange land 
He looked at me like I 
Was the one who should run 
We asked him to smile for a photograph 
Waited a while to see if we could make him laugh 

Oh...oh... 

A soldier asked for a cigarette 
His smiling face I can't forget 
He looked like me across the street 
But that's a long way here 

Oh...oh... 

And I wish you were here 
Oooh, and I wish you were here 

Oh...oh... 

Stranger 
A stranger in a strange land 
He look at me like I 
Was the one who should run 
I watched as he watched us get back on the bus 
I watched the way it was 
The way it was when he was with us 

And I really don't mind 
Sleeping on the floor 
But I couldn't sleep after what I saw 
I wrote this letter to tell you 
The way I feel 

Oooh, I wish you were here 
Oooh, I wish you were here 
To see what I could see 
To hear 
And I wish you were here 
Oh...oh... 







I don't know 
Man, I just got here 
You got me thinking 
I'm about to leave 


Some say maybe tomorrow 
New direction, hello 
What I know know know 
What I know know know 


I walk tall 
I walk in the wild wind 
I love to stare 
I love to watch myself grow 


Someday, maybe tomorrow 
New direction, hello 
Well I know know know 
Well I know know know 


Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 


And I'm promising nothing 
I'm just living a smile 
I casually arrange it 
I know...well I know know know 


Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 


I walk tall 
I walk in the wild wind 
I live an image 
Of plastic and gold 


Some say maybe tomorrow 
A resurrection, hello 
Well I know know know 
Well I know know know 
Well I know know know 
Well I know know know 


Oh... 


Oh... 


Oh...I need something 
I need someone 
I need you 


Oh...I've got something 
I've got someone 
I've got you 


Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 










I'm not afraid of anything in this world 
There's nothing you can throw at me that I haven't already heard 
I'm just trying to find a decent melody 
A song that I can sing in my own company 

You've got to get yourself together 
You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it 
Don't say that later will be better now you're stuck in a moment 
And you can't get out of it 

I will not forsake the colors that you bring 
But the nights you filled with fireworks 
They left you with nothing 
I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me 
I listen through your ears, through your eyes I can see 

And you are such a fool 
To worry like you do 
I know it's tough, and you can never get enough 
Of what you don't really need now ... my oh my 

You've got to get yourself together 
You've got stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it 
Oh love look at you now 
You've got yourself stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it 

I was unconscious, half asleep 
The water is warm till you discover how deep 
I wasn't jumping for me it was a fall 
It's a long way down to nothing at all 

You've got to get yourself together 
You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it 
Don't say that later will be better now 
You're stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it 

And if the night runs over 
And if the day won't last 
And if your way should falter 
Along this stony pass 
It's just a moment 
This time will pass








When you stop seeing beauty 
You start growing old 
The lines on your face 
are a map to your soul 

When you stop taking chances 
You'll stay where you sit 
You won't live any longer 
But it'll feel like it 

I lost myself in the summer rain 
I lost myself 
I lost myself in the summer rain 
In the summer rain 

Tequila and Orange 
Jamaica and rum 
At the Morella 
Honey on my tongue 

In a small boat on a generous sea 
You let me be your enemy 
Tiny hand 
With a grip on the world 
Holding our breath now 
Diving for pearls 

I lost myself in the summer rain 
I lost myself 
I lost myself in the summer rain 

Just as you find me 
Always I will be 
A little bit too free 
With myself 

Just as you find me 
Always I will be 
A little bit too free 
With myself 

I lost myself in the summer rain 
I lost myself 
Now there's no one else 
In the summer rain 

Raining down 
Raining down 
Rain 

Raining now 
Raining now 

Just as you find me 
Always I will be 
A little bit too free 
With myself 

Just as you find me 
Always I will be 
A little bit too free 
With myself 

It's not why you're running 
It's where you're going 
It's not what you're dreaming 
But what you're gonna do 

It's not where you're born 
It's where you belong 
It's not how weak 
But what will make you strong











I can't believe the news today 
Oh, I can't close my eyes 
And make it go away 
How long... 
How long must we sing this song? 
How long? How long... 
'cause tonight...we can be as one 
Tonight... 


Broken bottles under children's feet 
Bodies strewn across the dead end street 
But I won't heed the battle call 
It puts my back up 
Puts my back up against the wall 


Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
Sunday, Bloody Sunday 


And the battle's just begun 
There's many lost, but tell me who has won 
The trench is dug within our hearts 
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters 
Torn apart 


Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
Sunday, Bloody Sunday 


How long... 
How long must we sing this song? 
How long? How long... 
'cause tonight...we can be as one 
Tonight...tonight... 


Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
Sunday, Bloody Sunday 


Wipe the tears from your eyes 
Wipe your tears away 
Oh, wipe your tears away 
Oh, wipe your tears away 
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 
Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes 
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 


Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 


And it's true we are immune 
When fact is fiction and TV reality 
And today the millions cry 
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die 


(Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 


The real battle just begun 
To claim the victory Jesus won 
On... 


Sunday Bloody Sunday 
Sunday Bloody Sunday... 







Oh, the city's alight 
With lovers and lies 
Bright blue eyes 
Oh, the city is bright 
It's brighter than day tonight 

Surrender, Surrender 
Surrender, Surrender 

Sadie said she couldn't work out 
What it was all about 
And so she let go 
Now Sadie's on the street 
And the people she meets you know 
She tried to be a good girl and a good wife 
Raise a good family 
Lead a good life 
It's not good enough 
She got herself up on the 48th floor 
Gotta find out 
Find out what she's living for 

Surrender, Surrender 
Surrender, Surrender 

Tonight... 

Oh, the city's afire 
A passionate flame 
It knows me by name 
Oh, the city's desire 
To take me for more and more 
It's in the street, getting under my feet 
It's in the air, it's everywhere 
I look for you 
It's in the things I do and say 
If I wanna live I gotta 
Die to myself someday 

Papa sing my sing my sing my song 
Papa sing my sing my sing my song... 







And I'll coming to say goodbye 
Took inside and maids by buck bye 
More than dreams and the bottom come 
When she would come back, right and well 


And if you catch me I'll take your time 
Ride on home in monday's own 
Of this coldness in my heart 
And this whole world riding home 


Sweet baby Jane, sweet baby Jane 
Sweet baby Jane, sweet baby Jane 


And if you call, I'll come running 
And if you ask, I will be given 
And if you need me, I will be there 
When you rush when the feeling's gone 
I'll give you hope, I'll give you hate 
By the burden's own, by the sun but it burns on 






My love she throws me like a rubber ball 
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing 
But she won't catch me or break my fall 
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing 
Baby's got blue skies up ahead 
But in this I'm a rain cloud 
You know she wants a dry kind of love 
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing 


I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Ain't love the sweetest thing 


I wanted to run but she made me crawl 
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing 
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw 
Oh oh, the sweetest thing 
I know I got black eyes 
But they burn so brightly for her 
I guess it's a blind kind of love 
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing 


I'm losing you 
I'm losing you 
Ain't love the sweetest thing 
(Ain't love the sweetest thing) 
Ain't love the sweetest thing 
(Ain't love the sweetest thing) 


Blue eyed boy meets a brown eyed girl 
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing 
You can sew it up but you still see the tear 
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing 
Baby's got blue skies up ahead 
And in this I'm a rain cloud 
Ours is a stormy kind of love 
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing

The sweetest thing 
Oh, the sweetest thing 









Oh, baby child...

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon
You know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child


A man will beg
A man will crawl
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief

Over love...


A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

Love...we shine like a
Burning star
We're falling from the sky
Tonight



A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

Oh, yeah!
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange








Today...find my way 
I met a man in gray 
Yesterday 


Told a story, oh 
Can't bring them though 
He was so 


The dream is over 
The dream is over 
The dream is over 
(Wake up) 


Tomorrow, I will sit down fine 
I'm gonna pay good mind 
He left behind 


Saw...he knows I know 
Hovering I'll go 
He was so 


The dream is over 
The dream is over 
The dream is over 
(Wake up) 


The dream is over 
The dream is over 
The dream is over 
The dream is over 


The dream is over 
The dream is over.. 












Boy, stupid boy, 
Don't sit at the table 
Till you able to. 
Toy, broken toy. 
Shout, shout, you're inside out. 
If you don't know, the Electric Co. 

Red, running red 
Play for real, 
Talk and feel. 
Hold in your hand. 
You don't shout, 
You still feel guilty. 
If you don't know, 
The Electric Co. 

One, two, three, four 
Why must I hide from myself? 
When I need the crowd. 
Bring on the crowd. 
I love the crowd. 

If you don't know, 
The Electric Co... 






I have a lover 
A lover like no other 
She got soul, soul, soul, sweet soul 
And she teach me how to sing 


Shows me colours when there's none to see 
Gives me hope when I can't believe 
That for the first time 
I feel love 


I have a brother 
When I'm a brother in need 
I spend my whole time running 
He spends his running after me 


When I feel myself going down 
I just call and he comes around 
But for the first time 
I feel love 


My father is a rich man 
He wears a rich man's cloak 
Gave me the keys to his kingdom coming 
Gave me a cup of gold 


He said I have many mansions 
And there are many rooms to see 
But I left by the back door 
And I threw away the key 
And I threw away the key 
Yeah, I threw away the key 
Yeah, I threw away the key 


For the first time 
For the first time 
For the first time 


I feel love









Oh, baby child... 

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky

Alive in an ocean 
A world that I didn't see 
I walk the world backways 
It's aways the same ballgame 


That's out of mind 
Out of the living world 
Out of time 
I break all the rules 
They call me a fool 


I cartoon in motion 
A hero pretends no pain 
A clown slipping backwards 
You laugh at another's shame 


But I don't mind 
I know I'm limping low down 
I don't mind 
Winners or losers 
It's all just a game 
And I'm going down 
And I'm strolling down 


Life and an answer 
The key to an open door 
Admiting I'm laughing 
Living I'm limping more 


It's out of mind 
Out of the living world 
Out of time 
Winners or losers 
It's always a game 
And I'm going down 
But I'm strolling down 
To rout around 
And around, and around 
To round round 
There's a cloud 
There's a cloud 


So...the fool has found the golden key 
So...it's waiting there for you and me 


Just a fool, a street jester 
The hero of society 
Just a fool, a street jester 
Look at me, now can't you see 


A life in emotion 
A world I'm glad I didn't see 
A cartoon in motion 
A key to the same day 


I don't mind, I'm here to know 
I wanna go go go go go 


So...the fool has found the golden key 
It's so...it's waiting there for you and me 
Just a fool, a street jester 
The hero of society 
Just a fool, a street jester 
Look at me, now can't you see 







Oh my love 
It's a long way we've come 
From the freckled hills 
To the steel and glass canyons 


From the stony fields 
To hanging steel from skies 
From digging in our pockets 
For a reason not to say goodbye 


These are the hands that built America 
Ah ah ah...America 


Last saw your face 
In a watercolored sky 
As sea birds argue A long goodbye 


I took your kiss 
On the spray of a new lined star 
You gotta live in your dreams 
Don't make them so hard 


And these are the hands that built America 
Ah ah ah...America 


Of all of the promises 
Is this one we can keep 
Of all of the dreams 
Is this one still out of reach 



Its early fall 
There's a cloud in the New York skyline 
Innocence...dragged across a yellow line 


These are the hands that built America 
These are the hands that built America 
Ah ah ah...America 
Ah ah ah...America





A picture in grey 
Dorian Gray 
Just me 
By the sea 

And I felt like a star 
I felt the world could go far 
If they listened 
To what I said 
By the sea 

Washes my feet 
Washed my feet 
Splashes the soul of my shoes







If coke is a mystery 
and michael jackson history 
if beauty is truth 
and surgery the fountain of youth 
what am I to do 
have I got the gifts to get me through 
the gates of that mansion 

if oj is more than a drink 
and a big mack bigger than you think 
if perfume is an obsession 
and talk shows confession 
what have we got to lose 
another push and maybe we'll be through 
the gates of that mansion 

I never bought a lotto ticket 
I never parked in anyone's space 
the banks they're like cathedrals 
I guess casinos took their place 
LOVE ' COME ON DOWN' 
don't wake her she'll come around 

chance is a kind of religion 
where you're damned for plain hard luck 
I never did see that movie 
never did read the book 
love come on down 
let my numbers come around 

don't know if I can hold on 
don't know if I'm that strong 
don't know if I can wait that long 
till the colours come flashing 
and the lights go on 

then will there be no time for sorrow 
then will there be no time for shame 
and though I can't say why 
I know I've got to believe 

we'll go driving in that pool 
it's who you know that gets you through 
the gates of the playboy mansion 

then there will be no time for sorrow 
then there will be no time for pain 
then there will be no time for sorrow 
then will there be no time for shame 







Woah, woah... 
She's the refugee 
I see your face 
I see you staring back at me 
Woah, woah... 
She's the refugee 
Her mama say one day she's gonna 
Live in America 

In the morning 
She is waiting 
Waiting for the ship to sail 
Sail away 

Woah, woah... 
Her papa go to war 
He gonna fight 
But he don't know what for 
Woah, woah... 
Her papa go to war 
Her mama say one day he's gonna 
Come back from far away 

Help me 
How can you help me? 

In the evening 
She is waiting 
Waiting for her man to come 
And take her by her hand 
And take her to this promise land 

Woah, woah... 
She's a pretty face 
But at the wrong time 
In the wrong place 
Woah, woah... 
She's a pretty face 
Her mama say one day she's gonna 
Live in America 
Yeah, America 

Woah, woah... 
She's a refugee 
She's coming back, she's coming 
Keep you company 
Woah, woah... 
She's a refugee 
Her mama say one day she's gonna 
Live in America 






Ice 
Your only rivers run cold 
These city lights 
They shine as silver and gold 
Dug from the night 
Your eyes as black as coal 


Walk on by 
Walk on through 
Walk 'til you run 
And don't look back 
For here I am 


Carnival 
The wheels fly and the colors spin 
Through alcohol 
Red wine that punctures the skin 
Face to face 
In a dry and waterless place 


Walk on by 
Walk on through 
So sad to besiege your love so head on 
Stay this time 
Stay tonight in a lie 
I'm only asking but I... 
I think you know 
Come on take me away 
Come on take me away 
Come on take me home 
Home again 


And if the mountain should crumble 
Or disappear into the sea 
Not a tear, no not I 


Stay in this time 
Stay tonight in... 
Ever after, this love in time 
And if you save your love 
Save it all 


Don't push me too far 
Don't push me too far 
Tonight 
Tonight 
Tonight... 








I went out walking 
Through streets paved with gold 
Lifted some stones 
Saw the skin and bones 
Of a city without a soul 
I went out walking 
Under an atomic sky 
Where the ground won't turn 
And the rain it burns 
Like the tears when I said goodbye 

Yeah I went with nothing 
Nothing but the thought of you 
I went wandering 

I went drifting 
Through the capitals of tin 
Where men can't walk 
Or freely talk 
And sons turn their fathers in 
I stopped outside a church house 
Where the citizens like to sit 
They say they want the kingdom 
But they don't want God in it 

I went out riding 
Down that old eight lane 
I passed by a thousand signs 
Looking for my own name 

I went with nothing 
But the thought you'd be there too 
Looking for you 

I went out there 
In search of experience 
To taste and to touch 
And to feel as much 
As a man can 
Before he repents 

I went out searching 
Looking for one good man 
A spirit who would not bend or break 
Who would sit at his father's right hand 
I went out walking 
With a bible and a gun 
The word of God lay heavy on my heart 
I was sure I was the one 
Now Jesus, don't you wait up 
Jesus, I'll be home soon 
Yeah I went out for the papers 
Told her I'd be back by noon 

Yeah I left with nothing 
But the thought you'd be there too 
Looking for you 

Yeah I left with nothing 
Nothing but the thought of you 
I went wandering 










Spirit of the rising sun lift me up 
Hold me there and never let me fall 
Love me 'til I die, my heart won't wait 
Soon I will be loved... 


In this love song, love 
Love song, love song 


Hey, hey, love won't find 
Find its own way home 


In this love song, love 
Love, love song 


Sun shine, sun shine on me 
Sun shine, sun shine on me 


In this love song, love 
Love song, love song 


Hey, hey, love won't find 
Find its own way home 


In this love song, love song 
Love song, love song 
Sun shine on me 
Bring it through to my heart 
I would give you everything 
I will give you my desire 


Sun shine, sunshine on me 
Sun shine, sunshine on me 







Won't you come back tomorrow? 
Won't you come back tomorrow? 
Won't you come back tomorrow? 
Can I sleep tonight? 

Outside 
Somebody's outside 
Somebody's knocking at the door 
There's a black car parked 
At the side of the road 
Don't go to the door 
Don't go to the door 

I'm going out 
I'm going outside mother 
I'm going out there 

Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Will you be back tomorrow? 

Who broke the window? 
Who broke down the door? 
Who tore the curtain? 
And who was he for? 
Who healed the wounds? 
Who heals the scars? 

Open the door 
Open the door 

Won't you come back tomorrow? 
Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Will you be back tomorrow? 
Can I sleep tonight? 

Cause I want you...I...I want you...I really...I...I want...I...I... 
I want you to be back tomorrow! 
I want you to be back tomorrow! 
Will you be back tomorrow? 

La...la...la...la...la...la... 

Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Will you be back tomorrow? 
Open up, open up 
To the lamb of God 
To the love of he who made 
The light to see you 
He's coming back 
He's coming back 
I believe it 
Jesus coming 

I'm gonna be there 
I'm gonna be there mother 
I'm gonna be there mother 
I'm going out there 
Oooh...oooh 
And you're gonna be there 









Thank you
Don't mention it
I'm pleased to meet you
Don't think I'm very good at this
Let me show


I don't wanna know
I just wanna go (down)


F f falling...the world is by your side
Falling...did you find a place to hide


I just wanna know
I just wanna go


T t touching you

She said, the twenty second floor
But I said, I can't think what it's for


I just wanna know
I don't wanna go


T t touching you

I'm t t touching you
T t touching you
T t touching you


T t touching you








I know a girl, a girl called Party 
Party girl 
I know she wants more than a party 
Party girl 
And she won't tell me her name 


I know a boy, a boy called Trash 
Trash Can 
I know he does all that he can 
Wham Bam 
And he won't tell me his name 


I have a heart, a heart that's beating inside 
When I was three I thought the world revolved around me 
I was wrong 
And so I sing along 
And if you dance, then dance with me 


I know a girl, a girl called Party 
Party girl 
I know she wants more than a party 
Party girl 
I know a boy, a boy called Trampoline 
You know what I mean 


I think you know what he wants 
I think he knows what he wants 
I think he knows what he wants 







I like to smile 
But I like to mostly stay with you 
I like good times 
But I can't feel this without you 
By my song 
The heart is in the place 
I sing this song 
Probably so 


If I could sigh 
I'd tell the world I'd felt with you 
I like the time 
I like the feeling when 
I feel you in my arms 
I'll take you in my hand 
I'll let you go 
Somebody save me 
Somebody save me 


Sing it 
Sing my, sing my song 
We sing the same old song loud 


Smile...though your heart breaks in two 
Touch me...when will I be with you 


I like good times 
But I can feel it's going wrong 
You sing the same old song 
Now I think it's time to get it right 


Sing it out, sing out... 
Sing this same old song 


If I could swim, I'd swim in circles 
If I could drown, I'd, I'd drown with you 
If I had enough of my life 
I can't tell 
If I had enough of you 








In the distance
She saw me comin' 'round
I was calling out
I was calling out

Still shakin'
Still in pain
You put me back together again
I was cold and you clothed me honey
I was down and you lifted me honey

Angel...
Angel or devil
I was thirsty
And you wet my lips

You, I'm waiting for you
You, you set my desire
I trip through your wires
Yeah! Yahoo!

I was broken, bent out of shape
I was naked in the clothes you made
Lips were dry, throat like rust
You gave me shelter from the heat and the dust
No more water in the well
No more water, water

Angel...
Angel or devil
I was thirsty
And you wet my lips

You, I'm waiting for you
You, you set my desire
I trip through your wires

Yeah...I need...I need...
I need...I need it...
I need...I need...all I need...yeah!

Thunder, thunder on the mountain
There's a rain cloud in the desert sky
In the distance she saw me coming 'round
I was calling out
I was calling out










Six o'clock in the morning 
You're the last to hear the warning 
You've been tryin' to throw your arms around the world 
You've been falling off the sidewalk 
Your lips move but you can't talk 
Tryin' to throw your arms around the world 

Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you 
Be still 
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you 
Woman I will 
Oh! 

Sunrise like a nosebleed 
Your head hurts and you can't breathe 
How far you gonna go? 
Before you lose your way back home 
You've been tryin' to throw your arms 
Around the world 

Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you 
Woman be still 
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you 
Woman I will 

Yeah, I dreamed that I saw Dali 
With a supermarket trolley 
He was tryin' to throw his arms around a girl 
He took an open top beetle (open top beetle) 
Through the eye of a needle (eye of a needle) 
He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world 

Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you 
Woman be still 
I wanna run to you, run to you, run to you 
Oh, Woman I will 

Ah...and you just gotta, you just gotta make your faith...see... 
Oooh...oooh...yeah yeah...yeah yeah...yeah yeah...yeah yeah... 

Nothin' much to say I guess 
You're just the same as all the rest 
Been tryin' to throw your arms around the world 
And a woman needs a man 
Like a fish needs a bicycle 
When you're tryin' to throw your arms around the world 

I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you 
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you 
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you 
Woman be still 
Woman be still 
Be still 
Woman be still 
Woman I will 







I look into his eyes 
They're closed but I see something 
A teacher told me why 
I laugh when old men cry 

My body grows and grows 
It frightens me you know 
The old man tried to walk me home 
I thought he should have known 

Twilight 
Twilight, lost my way 
Twilight, can't find my way 

In the shadow boy meets man 
In the shadow boy meets man 
In the shadow boy meets man 
In the shadow boy meets man 

I'm running in the rain 
I'm caught in a late night play 
It's all, it's everything 
I'm soaking through the skin 

Twilight, darkened day 
Twilight, lost my way 
Twilight 
Twilight, can't find my way 

Can't find your way 
Can't find my way 
Can't find your way 

Twilight, darkened day 
Twilight, lost my way 
Twilight, night and day 
Twilight, can't find my way 

In the shadow boy meets man 
In the shadow boy meets man 
In the shadow boy meets man 
In the shadow boy meets man 







I don't know 
I don't know which side I'm on 
I don't know my right from left 
Or my right from wrong 
Say I'm a fool 
You say I'm not for you 
But if I'm a fool for you 
Oh, that's something 

Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts... 

Can't stop the dance 
Honey, this is my last chance 
I said, can't stop the dance 
Maybe this is my last chance 

Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts... 

They beat on black, beat on white 
Beat on everything don't get it right 
Beat on you, beat on me, beat on love 

I don't know 
How to say what's got to be said 
I don't know if it's black or white 
There's others see it red 
I don't get the answers right 
I'll leave that to you 
Is this love out of fashion? 
Or is it the time of year? 
Are these words distraction 
To the words you wanna hear? 

Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts beat as one 

I try to spit it out 
I try to explain 
The way I feel 
Oh, yeah 
Two hearts 

I can't stop the dance 
Maybe this is my last chance 
I said I can't stop the dance 
Maybe this is my last chance 
I said don't stop the dance 
Maybe this is my last chance 
I said can't stop the dance 
Maybe this is our last chance 
Maybe this is my last chance 
Maybe this is our last chance 








Two shots of happy, one shot of sad 
You think I'm no good, well I know I've been bad 
Took you to a place, now you can't get back 
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad 


Walked together down a dead end street 
We were mixing the bitter with the sweet 
Don't try to figure out what we might of had 
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad 


I'm just a singer, some say a sinner 
Rolling the dice, not always a winner 
You say I've been lucky, well hell I've made my own 
Not part of the crowd, but not feeling alone 


Under pressure, but not bent out of shape 
Surrounded, we always found an escape 
Drove me to drink, but hey that's not all bad 
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad 


Guess I've been greedy, all of my life 
Greedy with my children, my lovers, my wife 
Greedy for the good things as well as the bad 
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad 


Maybe it's just talk, saloon singing 
The chairs are all stacked, the swinging's stopped swinging 
You say I hurt you, you put the finger on yourself 
Then after you did it, you came crying for my help 


Two shots of happy, one shot of sad 
I'm not complaining, baby I'm glad 
You call it a compromise, well what's that 
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad 


Two shots of happy, one shot of sad 








Ooooh.... 
Sometimes I feel like I don't know 
Sometimes I feel like checkin' out 
I wanna get it wrong 
Can't always be strong 
And love it won't be long 

Oh sugar, don't you cry 
Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes 
You know I need you to be strong 
And the day is as dark as the night is long 
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean 
I'm in the black, can't see or be seen 

Baby, baby, baby...light my way 
Alright now... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 

You bury your treasure 
Where it can't be found 
But your love is like a secret 
That's been passed around 
There is a silence that comes to a house 
Where no one can sleep 
I guess it's the price of love 
I know it's not cheap 

Oh, come on... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 
Oh, come on! 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 

Oooh...ultraviolet... 
Oooh...ultraviolet... 
Oooh...ultraviolet... 
Oooh...ultraviolet... 

Baby, baby, baby...light my way 

I remember 
When we could sleep on stones 
Now we lie together 
In whispers and moans 
When I was all messed up 
And I had opera in my head 
Your love was a light bulb 
Hanging over my bed 

Baby, baby, baby...light my way 
Oh, come on... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 

Oooh...ultraviolet... 
Oooh...ultraviolet... 
Oooh...ultraviolet... 
Oooh...ultraviolet... 

Baby, baby, baby... 
Baby, baby, baby... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 

Baby, baby, baby... 
Baby, baby, baby... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 

Baby, baby, baby... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 

Baby, baby, baby...light my way 







Oh, oh my love 
Oh my darling 
I've hungered for your touch 
A long and lonely time 


And time goes by so slowly 
And time can do so much 
Are you still mine 


I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
God speed your love to me 


Lonely rivers flow 
To the sea, to the sea 
To the open arms of the sea 


Lonely rivers sigh 
Wait for me, wait for me 
I'll be coming home 
Wait for me 


Oh, oh my love 
Oh my darling 
I've hungered for your touch 
A long and lonely time 


And time goes by so slowly 
And time can do so much 
Are you still mine 


I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
God speed your love to me (it to me) 
God speed your love to me 
(I need your love) 
[Repeat until end] 






Haven't seen you in quite a while 
I was down the hold just passing time 
Last time we met was a low lit room 
We were as close together as a bride and groom 
We ate the food, we drank the wine 
Everybody having a good time 
Except you 
You were talking about the end of the world 

I took the money 
I spiked your drink 
You miss too much these days if you stop to think 
You lead me on with those innocent eyes 
You know I love the element of surprise 
In the garden I was playing the tart 
I kissed your lips and broke your heart 
You 
You were acting like it was the end of the world 

Love...love...love...love...love...love... 
Love...love...love...love...love...love... 
Love...love...love...love... 

In my dream I was drowning my sorrows 
But my sorrows, they learned to swim 
Surrounding me, going down on me 
Spilling over the brim 
Waves of regret and waves of joy 
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy 
You, you said you'd wait 
'Til the end of the world 








Hold me now, oh hold me now 
'Til this hour has gone around 
And I'm gone on the rising tide 
For to face Van Diemen's land 

It's a bitter pill I swallow here 
To be rent from one so dear 
We fought for justice and not for gain 
But the magistrate sent me away 

Now kings will rule and the poor will toil 
And tear their hands as they tear the soil 
But a day will come in this dawning age 
When an honest man sees an honest wage 

Hold me now, oh hold me now 
'til this hour has gone around 
And I'm gone on the rising tide 
For to face Van Diemen's land 




Oooo, taking it out
Taking it to
Taking the zoo
And they'll be view
I'll go with you
Baby it's true


You come home the chances
You come home alone
You broke into dancing
Did you do
How come to do



I know she wants your money
I know, so don't you...get it wrong
You got to get along
Sometimes you get it wrong
Won't taking it anymore...








Jesus Jesus help me 
I'm alone in this world 
and a fucked up world it is too 
tell me. tell me the story 
the one about eternity 
and the way it's all gonna be 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 

Jesus. I'm waiting here boss 
I know you're looking out for us 
but maybe your hands aren't free 
your Father. He made the world in seven 
He's in charge of heaven 
will you put a word in for me 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 

listen to the words they'll tell you what to do 
listen over the rhythm that's confusing you 
listen to the reed in the saxophone 
listen to the hum of the radio 
listen over sounds of blades in rotation 
listen through the traffic and the circulation 
listen as hope and peace try to rhyme 
listen over marching bands playing out their time 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 

Jesus, were you just around the corner 
did You think to try to warn her? 
or are you working on something new? 
If there's an order in all of this disorder 
is it like a tape recorder? 
can we rewind it just once more 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN 








And if the darkness is to keep us apart 
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off 
And if your glass heart should crack 
And for a second you turn back 
Oh no, be strong 

Oh, Oh 
Walk on 
Walk on 
What you got, they can't steal it 
No, they can't even feel it 
Walk on 
Walk on 
Stay safe tonight 

You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been 
A place that has to be believed to be seen 
You could have flown away a singing bird in an open cage 
Who will only fly, only fly, for freedom 

Oh Oh 
Walk on 
Walk on 
What you got, they can't deny it 
Can't sell it, or buy it 
Walk on 
Walk on 
You stay safe tonight 

And I know it aches 
Your heart, it breaks 
You can only take so much 

Walk on 
Walk on 
Leave it behind 
You've got to leave it behind 

All that you fashion 
All that you make 
All that you build 
And all that you break 
All that you measure 
All that you deal 
All you count on two fingers 
And all that you steal 
Hallellujah 

Hallellujah (repeat)





She said it wasn't cold 
She left her coat at home that day 
She wore canvas shoes 
White canvas shoes 
Around her neck 
She wore a silver necklace 
It was given to me by my father, she said 
It was given to me 


She took the back way home 
Passed the lights and the Summerhill 
Turned left onto the North Strand 
And on, and towards the sea 


He said he was an artist 
But he really painted billboards 
In large capital letters 
Large capital letters 
He was telling jokes 
Nobody else would listen to him 


I saw you that day 
Your lips were cherry red 
Your legs were crossed 
Your arms wide open 


Your hair was coloured gold 
Like a field of corn 
You were blown by the wind 
You were blown by the wind 


Walk, walk, walk...to the water 
Walk with me a while 
Walk, walk, walk...to the roadside 
Walk me in the light 


A room in the Royal Hotel 
Sea facing views 
A man with a suitcase 
Full of things he doesn't need 
I'm looking through your window 
I'm walking through your doorway 
I'm on the outside 
Let me in 
Let me love you 
Let me love you 
Let me... 


Walk, walk, walk...to the water 
Walk with me...yeah 
Walk, walk, walk...to the roadside 
Walk with me again 







When you look at the world 
What is it that you see 
People find all kinds of things 
That bring them to their knees 


I see an expression 
So clear and so true 
That it changes the atmosphere 
When you walk (in)to the room 


So I try to be like you 
Try to feel it like you do 
But without you it's no use 
I can't see what you see 
When I look at the world 


When the night is someone else's 
And you're trying to get some sleep 
When your thoughts are too expensive 
To ever want to keep 


When there's all kinds of chaos 
And everyone is walking lame 
You don't even blink now do you 
Or even look away 


So I try to be like you 
Try to feel it like you do 
But without you it's no use 
I can't see what you see 
When I look at the world 


I can't wait any longer 
I can't wait 'til I'm stronger 
Can't wait any longer 
To see what you see 
When I look at the world 


I'm in the waiting room 
I can't see for the smoke 
I think of you and your holy book 
When the rest of us choke 


Tell me, tell me 
What do you see 
Tell me, tell me 
What's wrong with me 






I was a sailor, I was lost at sea 
I was under the waves 
Before love rescued me 
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread 
Now I stand accused of the things I've said 


Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train 
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
But I did what I did before love came to town 


I used to make love under a red sunset 
I was making promises I was soon to forget 
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown 
But I left her standing before love came to town 


I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream 
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream 
As the music played I saw my life turn around 
That was the day before love came to town 


When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train 
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
But I did what I did before love came to town 


I was there when they crucified my Lord 
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword 
I threw the dice when they pierced his side 
But I've seen love conquer the great divide 


When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train 
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
But I did what I did before love came to town 







Did you get it 
Did you need it 
Did you really 
What you wanted 
Was it good in the sun 
Did you really have the fun 


Did you crack it 
Did you grab it 
Did you reel it 
Like a rabbit 
Did you walk 
Did you run 
Did you move this here 
Uh huh 


And how could you do 
And make it so, sing this song 
Where did it all go wrong 
Where did it all go wrong 


Did you grab it 
Did you want it 
Is it really what you wanted 
Did you run in the sun 
Did you imitate a walk 


Did you answer 
Did you grab it 
Did you gun it like a rabbit 
Did you walk 
Did you run 
Can you feel you rising up 


And how can you do 
And when you sang it in the song 
And it sank, and it threw 
Where did it all go wrong 


Did you drown it 
Did you roll it 
Did you smash it 
Did you warm it 
Did you clean it 
Clean it up 
Did you rub it 
Did you soap 


Did you screen it 
Did you ream it 
Did you ruin it 
Did you feed it 
Is warm in the sun 
When the weather's getting warm 


And the world is at your feet 
And it is our time to say 
It's all gone wrong 
Where did it all go wrong 
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) 


You take me, baby, in circles, yes 
Darling, darling, darling...I want you 
Why oh, why oh, why oh...stony rose 
You lose your guy 
You walk on by 
You walk on by 
You walk on by 
You walk on by 
Did you lose the guy 
Did you lose the guy 
Did you lose the guy 
Did you lose the guy... 







I want to run 
I want to hide 
I want to tear down the walls 
That hold me inside 
I want to reach out 
And touch the flame 
Where the streets have no name 


I want to feel sunlight on my face 
I see the dust cloud disappear 
Without a trace 
I want to take shelter from the poison rain 
Where the streets have no name 


Where the streets have no name 
Where the streets have no name 
We're still building 
Then burning down love 
Burning down love 
And when I go there 
I go there with you 
It's all I can do 


The city's aflood 
And our love turns to rust 
We're beaten and blown by the wind 
Trampled in dust 
I'll show you a place 
High on a desert plain 
Where the streets have no name 


Where the streets have no name 
Where the streets have no name 
We're still building 
Then burning down love 
Burning down love 
And when I go there 
I go there with you 
It's all I can do 
Our love turns to rust 
We're beaten and blown by the wind 
Blown by the wind 
Oh, and I see love 
See our love turn to rust 
We're beaten and blown by the wind 
Blown by the wind 
Oh, when I go there 
I go there with you 
It's all I can do 





You're dangerous 'cause you're honest
You're dangerous, you don't know what you want
Well you left my heart empty as a vacant lot
For any spirit to haunt

Hey hey sha la la
Hey hey

You're an accident waiting to happen
You're a piece of glass left in a beach
Well, you tell me things I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me just out of reach

Hey hey sha la la
Hey hey sha la la

Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?

Well you stole it 'cause I needed the cash
And you killed it 'cause I wanted revenge
Well you lied to me 'cause I asked you to
Baby, can we still be friends?

Hey hey sha la la
Hey hey sha la la

Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?

Oh, the deeper I spin
Oh, the hunter will sin for your ivory skin
Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees the river laughing at you and me
Hallelujah, heavens white rose
The doors you open
I just can't close

Don't turn around, don't turn around again
Don't turn around, your gypsy heart
Don't turn around, don't turn around again
Don't turn around, and don't look back
Come on now love, don't you look back!

Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses?
Who's gonna take the place of me?

Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna tame the heart of thee?






In the days 
When we were swinging form the trees 
I was a monkey 
Stealing honey from a swarm of bees 


I could taste 
I could taste you even then 
And I would chase you down the wind 


You can go there if you please 
Wild honey 
And if you go then go with me 
Wild honey 


Did I know you 
Did I know you even then 
Before the clocks kept time 
Before the world was made 


From the cruel sun 
You were shelter 
You were my shelter and my shade 


If you go there with me 
Wild honey 
You can do just what you please 
Wild honey 


Yeah, just blowing in the breeze 
Wild honey 
Wild, wild, wild 


I'm still standing 
I'm still standing where you left me 
Are you still growing wild 
With everything tame around you 


I send you flowers 
Cut flowers for your hall 
I know your garden is full 
But is there sweetness at all 


What is soul 
Love me 
Give me soul 


If you go then go with me 
Wild honey 
Won't you take me, take me please 
Wild honey 


Yeah, swinging through the trees 
Wild honey 
Wild, wild, wild 







In a field by a river 
my love and I did lie 
And on my naked shoulder 
she too proud to cry 
She said that I must leave her 
an icy tear she froze 
How could I melt the heart 
Of a Wild Irish Rose 


Well a gypsy she has made of me 
A servent of the street 
And back to bed I've travelled 
To taste a love as sweet 
Well the heart it knows no reasons 
And reason never knows 
As I lie with them I'm thinking 
Of a Wild Irish Rose 


Well I saw the city of angels 
It brought a devil out in me 
And Hell's hotel on Sunset 
Showed a whore no mercy 
As the orange sky was screaming 
From the roof I let her go 
These are the dizzying heights that brought me 
My Wild Irish Rose 


Now red is the rose 
That she layed on my grave 
A life is what she wanted 
And a life I surely gave 
Like a hundred men before me 
They lay lying here in rows 
Young men, bloody 
As a Wild Irish Rose 







Innocent, and in a sense I am 
Guilty of the crime that's now in hand 
Such a nice day! 
Throw your life away 
Such a nice day! 
Let it go 

Cold these eyes, I...can't believe it 
Cold, this heart is slow 
Heart is stone 

Call me 
Such a cold heart 
Such a cold man 
To watch you tear your self apart 

So lay me down 
My soul to give 
So lay me down 
The longest sleep 
Oh...the longest sleep 

In I come and out you go 
You get 
Here we are again 
Now, place your bets 
Is this the time!? 
The time to win or lose 
Is this the time!? 
The time to choose 

Cold these eyes, I...can't believe it 
So deep inside a cold fire 
Cold, this heart is slow... 
Heart is stone 

Any time your on the air 
Kiss me...Ah! Would you? Ooh! 
Won't you tell me now 
That's right, just keep me going 

In some white track 
You come right back 
Cartoon cutout 
Cut throat let out 
I'm on your side 
Be on the both side 
I'm on right track 
You get off my back 
I'm no dope 
I give you hope 
Here's the rope 
Here's the rope 
Now...swing away! 







Oh, and where do we go? 
Where do we go from here? 
Where to go 
To the side of a hill 
Blood was spilt 
We were still looking at each other 

Oh, we're goin' back there 
Jerusalem 
Jerusalem 

Shout 
Shout 
With a shout, shout it out 
Shout 
Shout it out 

I wanna go 
To the foot of the Messiah 
To the foot of he who made me see 
To the side of a hill 
Where we were still 
We were filled 
With our love 

We're gonna be there again 
Jerusalem 
Jerusalem 
Jerusalem 
Jerusalem 
Jerusalem 
Jerusalem 

Woah...oh... 
Shout 
Shout 
With a shout 
Shout 
With a shout 






See the stone set in your eyes 
See the thorn twist in your side 
I wait for you 


Sleight of hand and twist of fate 
On a bed of nails she makes me wait 
And I wait without you 


With or without you 
With or without you 


Through the storm we reach the shore 
You give it all but I want more 
And I'm waiting for you 


With or without you 
With or without you 
I can't live 
With or without you 


And you give yourself away 
And you give yourself away 
And you give 
And you give 
And you give yourself away 


My hands are tied 
My body bruised, she's got me with 
Nothing to win and 
Nothing left to lose 


And you give yourself away 
And you give yourself away 
And you give 
And you give 
And you give yourself away 


With or without you 
With or without you 
I can't live 
With or without you 


With or without you 
With or without you 
I can't live 
With or without you 
With or without you 







It's time to go again 
To your blue room 
Got some questions to ask of you 
In your blue room 


The air is clean 
Your skin is clear 
I've had enough fun hanging 'round here 
It's a different kind of conversation 
Your blue room 


Saw me coming 
In outside 
Saw me coming 
Somewhere I can hide 


And time is a string of pearls...your blue room 
(I'm a swinger) 
See the future just hanging there...your blue room 
A new frame, a new perspective 
Looking down on my objectives 
Your instructions whatever their directions 
Your blue room 


Saw me coming 
East by the moon 
Saw me coming 
Can you feel 


(It's allright) 


Your blue room 


One day I'll be back...your blue room 
Yeah, I hope I remember where it's at...your blue room 


We see me slide 
Won't you give me a home 
So much for change 


Zooming in 
Zooming out 
Nothing I can't do without 
A lens to it all up close 
Magnifying what no one knows 
Never in company 
Never alone 
No car alarm 
No cellular phone 






I'm ready 
I'm ready for the laughing gas 
I'm ready 
I'm ready for what's next 
I'm ready to duck 
I'm ready to dive 
I'm ready to say 
I'm glad to be alive 
I'm ready 
I'm ready for the push 

In the cool of the night 
In the wartmth of the breeze 
I'll be crawling 'round 
On my hands and knees 

Just down the line Zoo Station 
Gotta make it on time oh, Zoo Station 

I'm ready 
I'm ready for the gridlock 
I'm ready to take it to the street 
I'm ready for the shuffle 
Ready for the deal 
Ready to let go of the steering wheel 
I'm ready 
Ready for the crush 

(She's just down the line)...Zoo Station 
(Got to make it on time)...Zoo Station 

Alright 
Alright, alright, alright, alright 
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby 
Hey baby 
It's alright, it's alright 

Alright, you can turn it up! 

Time is a train 
Makes the future the past 
Leaves you standing in the station 
Your face pressed up against the glass 

I'm just down the line from your love...(Zoo Station) 
You know I'm under the sign...(Zoo Station) 
I've gotta make it on time 
Make it on time...(Zoo Station) 
I'm gonna be there...(Zoo Station) 
That's alright...(Zoo Station) 
Just two stops down the line from your love...(Zoo Station) 
Just a stop down the line 






(what do you want?) 
(what do you want?) 

Zooropa...vorsprung durch technik (a step ahead through technology) 
Zooropa...be all that you can be 
Be a winner 
Eat to get slimmer 

Zooropa...a bluer kind of white 
Zooropa...it could be yours tonight 
We're mild and green 
And squeaky clean 

Zooropa...better by design 
Zooropa...fly the friendly skies 
Through appliance of science 
We've got that ring of confidence 

And I have no compass 
And I have no map 
And I have no reasons 
No reasons to get back 

And I have no religion 
And I don't know what's what 
And I don't know the limit 
The limit of what we've got 

Don't worry baby, it'll be alright 
You got the right shoes 
To get you through the night 
It's cold outside, but brightly lit 
Skip the subway 
Let's go to the overground 
Get your head out of the mud baby 
Put flowers in the mud baby 
Overground 

No particular place names 
No particular song 
I've been hiding 
What am I hiding from 

Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright 
Uncertainty can be a guiding light 
I hear voices, ridiculous voices 
Out in the slipstream 
Let's go, let's go overground 
Take your head out of the mud baby 

She's gonna dream up 
The world she wants to live in 
She's gonna dream out loud 
She's gonna dream out loud 
Dream out loud
